45 Information about Project Gutenberg one page
46 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The
47 fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
48 to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
49 searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc This
50 projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value
51 per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
52 million dollars per hour this year we will have to do four text
53 files per month thus upping our productivity from one million
54 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
55 Files by the December 31 2001 [10000 x 100000000=Trillion]
56 This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
57 which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
58 of the year 2001

193 THE SONNETS
194 by William Shakespeare
195 1
196 From fairest creatures we desire increase
197 That thereby beauty's rose might never die
198 But as the riper should by time decease
199 His tender heir might bear his memory
200 But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
201 Feed'st thy light's flame with selfsubstantial fuel
202 Making a famine where abundance lies
203 Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
204 Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
205 And only herald to the gaudy spring
206 Within thine own bud buriest thy content
207 And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding
208 Pity the world or else this glutton be
209 To eat the world's due by the grave and thee
210 2
211 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
212 And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field
213 Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
214 Will be a tattered weed of small worth held
215 Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
216 Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
217 To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
218 Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
219 How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use
220 If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
221 Shall sum my count and make my old excuse'
222 Proving his beauty by succession thine
223 This were to be new made when thou art old
224 And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold
225 3
226 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
227 Now is the time that face should form another
228 Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
229 Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
230 For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
231 Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
232 Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
233 Of his selflove to stop posterity
234 Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
235 Calls back the lovely April of her prime
236 So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
237 Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
238 But if thou live remembered not to be
239 Die single and thine image dies with thee
240 4
241 Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
242 Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy
243 Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
244 And being frank she lends to those are free
245 Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
246 The bounteous largess given thee to give
247 Profitless usurer why dost thou use
248 So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
249 For having traffic with thy self alone
250 Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
251 Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
252 What acceptable audit canst thou leave
253 Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
254 Which used lives th executor to be
255 5
256 Those hours that with gentle work did frame
257 The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
258 Will play the tyrants to the very same
259 And that unfair which fairly doth excel
260 For neverresting time leads summer on
261 To hideous winter and confounds him there
262 Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
263 Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness every where
264 Then were not summer's distillation left
265 A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
266 Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft
267 Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
268 But flowers distilled though they with winter meet
269 Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
270 6
271 Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
272 In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
273 Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
274 With beauty's treasure ere it be selfkilled
275 That use is not forbidden usury
276 Which happies those that pay the willing loan
277 That's for thy self to breed another thee
278 Or ten times happier be it ten for one
279 Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
280 If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
281 Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
282 Leaving thee living in posterity
283 Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair
284 To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir
285 7
286 Lo in the orient when the gracious light
287 Lifts up his burning head each under eye
288 Doth homage to his newappearing sight
289 Serving with looks his sacred majesty
290 And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
291 Resembling strong youth in his middle age
292 Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
293 Attending on his golden pilgrimage
294 But when from highmost pitch with weary car
295 Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
296 The eyes fore duteous now converted are
297 From his low tract and look another way
298 So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon
299 Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
300 8
301 Music to hear why hear'st thou music sadly
302 Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
303 Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
304 Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
305 If the true concord of welltuned sounds
306 By unions married do offend thine ear
307 They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
308 In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
309 Mark how one string sweet husband to another
310 Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
311 Resembling sire and child and happy mother
312 Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
313 Whose speechless song being many seeming one
314 Sings this to thee 'Thou single wilt prove none'
315 9
316 Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
317 That thou consum'st thy self in single life
318 Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
319 The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
320 The world will be thy widow and still weep
321 That thou no form of thee hast left behind
322 When every private widow well may keep
323 By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind
324 Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
325 Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
326 But beauty's waste hath in the world an end
327 And kept unused the user so destroys it
328 No love toward others in that bosom sits
329 That on himself such murd'rous shame commits
330 10
331 For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
332 Who for thy self art so unprovident
333 Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
334 But that thou none lov'st is most evident
335 For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
336 That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
337 Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
338 Which to repair should be thy chief desire
339 O change thy thought that I may change my mind
340 Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
341 Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
342 Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove
343 Make thee another self for love of me
344 That beauty still may live in thine or thee
345 11
346 As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st
347 In one of thine from that which thou departest
348 And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
349 Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
350 Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
351 Without this folly age and cold decay
352 If all were minded so the times should cease
353 And threescore year would make the world away
354 Let those whom nature hath not made for store
355 Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
356 Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
357 Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
358 She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
359 Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
360 12
361 When I do count the clock that tells the time
362 And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
363 When I behold the violet past prime
364 And sable curls all silvered o'er with white
365 When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
366 Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
367 And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
368 Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
369 Then of thy beauty do I question make
370 That thou among the wastes of time must go
371 Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
372 And die as fast as they see others grow
373 And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
374 Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
375 13
376 O that you were your self but love you are
377 No longer yours than you your self here live
378 Against this coming end you should prepare
379 And your sweet semblance to some other give
380 So should that beauty which you hold in lease
381 Find no determination then you were
382 Your self again after your self's decease
383 When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
384 Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
385 Which husbandry in honour might uphold
386 Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
387 And barren rage of death's eternal cold
388 O none but unthrifts dear my love you know
389 You had a father let your son say so
390 14
391 Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
392 And yet methinks I have astronomy
393 But not to tell of good or evil luck
394 Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
395 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
396 Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
397 Or say with princes if it shall go well
398 By oft predict that I in heaven find
399 But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
400 And constant stars in them I read such art
401 As truth and beauty shall together thrive
402 If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
403 Or else of thee this I prognosticate
404 Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date
405 15
406 When I consider every thing that grows
407 Holds in perfection but a little moment
408 That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
409 Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
410 When I perceive that men as plants increase
411 Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky
412 Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
413 And wear their brave state out of memory
414 Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
415 Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
416 Where wasteful time debateth with decay
417 To change your day of youth to sullied night
418 And all in war with Time for love of you
419 As he takes from you I engraft you new
420 16
421 But wherefore do not you a mightier way
422 Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
423 And fortify your self in your decay
424 With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
425 Now stand you on the top of happy hours
426 And many maiden gardens yet unset
427 With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
428 Much liker than your painted counterfeit
429 So should the lines of life that life repair
430 Which this Time's pencil or my pupil pen
431 Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
432 Can make you live your self in eyes of men
433 To give away your self keeps your self still
434 And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
435 17
436 Who will believe my verse in time to come
437 If it were filled with your most high deserts
438 Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
439 Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
440 If I could write the beauty of your eyes
441 And in fresh numbers number all your graces
442 The age to come would say this poet lies
443 Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
444 So should my papers yellowed with their age
445 Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
446 And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
447 And stretched metre of an antique song
448 But were some child of yours alive that time
449 You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
450 18
451 Shall I compare thee to a summer's day
452 Thou art more lovely and more temperate
453 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
454 And summer's lease hath all too short a date
455 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
456 And often is his gold complexion dimmed
457 And every fair from fair sometime declines
458 By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed
459 But thy eternal summer shall not fade
460 Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
461 Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade
462 When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
463 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
464 So long lives this and this gives life to thee
465 19
466 Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws
467 And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
468 Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws
469 And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood
470 Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
471 And do whate'er thou wilt swiftfooted Time
472 To the wide world and all her fading sweets
473 But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
474 O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow
475 Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
476 Him in thy course untainted do allow
477 For beauty's pattern to succeeding men
478 Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
479 My love shall in my verse ever live young
480 20
481 A woman's face with nature's own hand painted
482 Hast thou the master mistress of my passion
483 A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
484 With shifting change as is false women's fashion
485 An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
486 Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
487 A man in hue all hues in his controlling
488 Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth
489 And for a woman wert thou first created
490 Till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
491 And by addition me of thee defeated
492 By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
493 But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure
494 Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure
495 21
496 So is it not with me as with that muse
497 Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
498 Who heaven it self for ornament doth use
499 And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
500 Making a couplement of proud compare
501 With sun and moon with earth and sea's rich gems
502 With April's firstborn flowers and all things rare
503 That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems
504 O let me true in love but truly write
505 And then believe me my love is as fair
506 As any mother's child though not so bright
507 As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air
508 Let them say more that like of hearsay well
509 I will not praise that purpose not to sell
510 22
511 My glass shall not persuade me I am old
512 So long as youth and thou are of one date
513 But when in thee time's furrows I behold
514 Then look I death my days should expiate
515 For all that beauty that doth cover thee
516 Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
517 Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
518 How can I then be elder than thou art
519 O therefore love be of thyself so wary
520 As I not for my self but for thee will
521 Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
522 As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
523 Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
524 Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again
525 23
526 As an unperfect actor on the stage
527 Who with his fear is put beside his part
528 Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
529 Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart
530 So I for fear of trust forget to say
531 The perfect ceremony of love's rite
532 And in mine own love's strength seem to decay
533 O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might
534 O let my looks be then the eloquence
535 And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
536 Who plead for love and look for recompense
537 More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
538 O learn to read what silent love hath writ
539 To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit
540 24
541 Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
542 Thy beauty's form in table of my heart
543 My body is the frame wherein 'tis held
544 And perspective it is best painter's art
545 For through the painter must you see his skill
546 To find where your true image pictured lies
547 Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still
548 That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
549 Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
550 Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
551 Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun
552 Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
553 Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
554 They draw but what they see know not the heart
555 25
556 Let those who are in favour with their stars
557 Of public honour and proud titles boast
558 Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
559 Unlooked for joy in that I honour most
560 Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
561 But as the marigold at the sun's eye
562 And in themselves their pride lies buried
563 For at a frown they in their glory die
564 The painful warrior famoused for fight
565 After a thousand victories once foiled
566 Is from the book of honour razed quite
567 And all the rest forgot for which he toiled
568 Then happy I that love and am beloved
569 Where I may not remove nor be removed
570 26
571 Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
572 Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
573 To thee I send this written embassage
574 To witness duty not to show my wit
575 Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
576 May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
577 But that I hope some good conceit of thine
578 In thy soul's thought all naked will bestow it
579 Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
580 Points on me graciously with fair aspect
581 And puts apparel on my tattered loving
582 To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
583 Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
584 Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
585 27
586 Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
587 The dear respose for limbs with travel tired
588 But then begins a journey in my head
589 To work my mind when body's work's expired
590 For then my thoughts from far where I abide
591 Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
592 And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
593 Looking on darkness which the blind do see
594 Save that my soul's imaginary sight
595 Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
596 Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
597 Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
598 Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
599 For thee and for my self no quiet find
600 28
601 How can I then return in happy plight
602 That am debarred the benefit of rest
603 When day's oppression is not eased by night
604 But day by night and night by day oppressed
605 And each though enemies to either's reign
606 Do in consent shake hands to torture me
607 The one by toil the other to complain
608 How far I toil still farther off from thee
609 I tell the day to please him thou art bright
610 And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
611 So flatter I the swartcomplexioned night
612 When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
613 But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
614 And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
615 29
616 When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes
617 I all alone beweep my outcast state
618 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
619 And look upon my self and curse my fate
620 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
621 Featured like him like him with friends possessed
622 Desiring this man's art and that man's scope
623 With what I most enjoy contented least
624 Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
625 Haply I think on thee and then my state
626 Like to the lark at break of day arising
627 From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate
628 For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
629 That then I scorn to change my state with kings
630 30
631 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
632 I summon up remembrance of things past
633 I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
634 And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste
635 Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
636 For precious friends hid in death's dateless night
637 And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe
638 And moan th expense of many a vanished sight
639 Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
640 And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
641 The sad account of forebemoaned moan
642 Which I new pay as if not paid before
643 But if the while I think on thee dear friend
644 All losses are restored and sorrows end
645 31
646 Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
647 Which I by lacking have supposed dead
648 And there reigns love and all love's loving parts
649 And all those friends which I thought buried
650 How many a holy and obsequious tear
651 Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
652 As interest of the dead which now appear
653 But things removed that hidden in thee lie
654 Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
655 Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
656 Who all their parts of me to thee did give
657 That due of many now is thine alone
658 Their images I loved I view in thee
659 And thou all they hast all the all of me
660 32
661 If thou survive my wellcontented day
662 When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
663 And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
664 These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
665 Compare them with the bett'ring of the time
666 And though they be outstripped by every pen
667 Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
668 Exceeded by the height of happier men
669 O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
670 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
671 A dearer birth than this his love had brought
672 To march in ranks of better equipage
673 But since he died and poets better prove
674 Theirs for their style I'll read his for his love'
675 33
676 Full many a glorious morning have I seen
677 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
678 Kissing with golden face the meadows green
679 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
680 Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
681 With ugly rack on his celestial face
682 And from the forlorn world his visage hide
683 Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
684 Even so my sun one early morn did shine
685 With all triumphant splendour on my brow
686 But out alack he was but one hour mine
687 The region cloud hath masked him from me now
688 Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
689 Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth
690 34
691 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
692 And make me travel forth without my cloak
693 To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
694 Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke
695 'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
696 To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face
697 For no man well of such a salve can speak
698 That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
699 Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
700 Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
701 Th offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
702 To him that bears the strong offence's cross
703 Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
704 And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
705 35
706 No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
707 Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
708 Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
709 And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
710 All men make faults and even I in this
711 Authorizing thy trespass with compare
712 My self corrupting salving thy amiss
713 Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
714 For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
715 Thy adverse party is thy advocate
716 And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence
717 Such civil war is in my love and hate
718 That I an accessary needs must be
719 To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
720 36
721 Let me confess that we two must be twain
722 Although our undivided loves are one
723 So shall those blots that do with me remain
724 Without thy help by me be borne alone
725 In our two loves there is but one respect
726 Though in our lives a separable spite
727 Which though it alter not love's sole effect
728 Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight
729 I may not evermore acknowledge thee
730 Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
731 Nor thou with public kindness honour me
732 Unless thou take that honour from thy name
733 But do not so I love thee in such sort
734 As thou being mine mine is thy good report
735 37
736 As a decrepit father takes delight
737 To see his active child do deeds of youth
738 So I made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
739 Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
740 For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
741 Or any of these all or all or more
742 Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
743 I make my love engrafted to this store
744 So then I am not lame poor nor despised
745 Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
746 That I in thy abundance am sufficed
747 And by a part of all thy glory live
748 Look what is best that best I wish in thee
749 This wish I have then ten times happy me
750 38
751 How can my muse want subject to invent
752 While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
753 Thine own sweet argument too excellent
754 For every vulgar paper to rehearse
755 O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
756 Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
757 For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee
758 When thou thy self dost give invention light
759 Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
760 Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
761 And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
762 Eternal numbers to outlive long date
763 If my slight muse do please these curious days
764 The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
765 39
766 O how thy worth with manners may I sing
767 When thou art all the better part of me
768 What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
769 And what is't but mine own when I praise thee
770 Even for this let us divided live
771 And our dear love lose name of single one
772 That by this separation I may give
773 That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
774 O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
775 Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
776 To entertain the time with thoughts of love
777 Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
778 And that thou teachest how to make one twain
779 By praising him here who doth hence remain
780 40
781 Take all my loves my love yea take them all
782 What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
783 No love my love that thou mayst true love call
784 All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
785 Then if for my love thou my love receivest
786 I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
787 But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
788 By wilful taste of what thy self refusest
789 I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
790 Although thou steal thee all my poverty
791 And yet love knows it is a greater grief
792 To bear greater wrong than hate's known injury
793 Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
794 Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
795 41
796 Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
797 When I am sometime absent from thy heart
798 Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
799 For still temptation follows where thou art
800 Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
801 Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
802 And when a woman woos what woman's son
803 Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
804 Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
805 And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
806 Who lead thee in their riot even there
807 Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
808 Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
809 Thine by thy beauty being false to me
810 42
811 That thou hast her it is not all my grief
812 And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
813 That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
814 A loss in love that touches me more nearly
815 Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
816 Thou dost love her because thou know'st I love her
817 And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
818 Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her
819 If I lose thee my loss is my love's gain
820 And losing her my friend hath found that loss
821 Both find each other and I lose both twain
822 And both for my sake lay on me this cross
823 But here's the joy my friend and I are one
824 Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
825 43
826 When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
827 For all the day they view things unrespected
828 But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
829 And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
830 Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
831 How would thy shadow's form form happy show
832 To the clear day with thy much clearer light
833 When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
834 How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
835 By looking on thee in the living day
836 When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
837 Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
838 All days are nights to see till I see thee
839 And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
840 44
841 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
842 Injurious distance should not stop my way
843 For then despite of space I would be brought
844 From limits far remote where thou dost stay
845 No matter then although my foot did stand
846 Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
847 For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
848 As soon as think the place where he would be
849 But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
850 To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
851 But that so much of earth and water wrought
852 I must attend time's leisure with my moan
853 Receiving nought by elements so slow
854 But heavy tears badges of either's woe
855 45
856 The other two slight air and purging fire
857 Are both with thee wherever I abide
858 The first my thought the other my desire
859 These presentabsent with swift motion slide
860 For when these quicker elements are gone
861 In tender embassy of love to thee
862 My life being made of four with two alone
863 Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
864 Until life's composition be recured
865 By those swift messengers returned from thee
866 Who even but now come back again assured
867 Of thy fair health recounting it to me
868 This told I joy but then no longer glad
869 I send them back again and straight grow sad
870 46
871 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
872 How to divide the conquest of thy sight
873 Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar
874 My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
875 My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
876 A closet never pierced with crystal eyes
877 But the defendant doth that plea deny
878 And says in him thy fair appearance lies
879 To side this title is impanelled
880 A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
881 And by their verdict is determined
882 The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part
883 As thus mine eye's due is thy outward part
884 And my heart's right thy inward love of heart
885 47
886 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
887 And each doth good turns now unto the other
888 When that mine eye is famished for a look
889 Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
890 With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
891 And to the painted banquet bids my heart
892 Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
893 And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
894 So either by thy picture or my love
895 Thy self away art present still with me
896 For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
897 And I am still with them and they with thee
898 Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
899 Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight
900 48
901 How careful was I when I took my way
902 Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
903 That to my use it might unused stay
904 From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
905 But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
906 Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
907 Thou best of dearest and mine only care
908 Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
909 Thee have I not locked up in any chest
910 Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
911 Within the gentle closure of my breast
912 From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
913 And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear
914 For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
915 49
916 Against that time if ever that time come
917 When I shall see thee frown on my defects
918 When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
919 Called to that audit by advised respects
920 Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
921 And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
922 When love converted from the thing it was
923 Shall reasons find of settled gravity
924 Against that time do I ensconce me here
925 Within the knowledge of mine own desert
926 And this my hand against my self uprear
927 To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
928 To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
929 Since why to love I can allege no cause
930 50
931 How heavy do I journey on the way
932 When what I seek my weary travel's end
933 Doth teach that case and that repose to say
934 'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend'
935 The beast that bears me tired with my woe
936 Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
937 As if by some instinct the wretch did know
938 His rider loved not speed being made from thee
939 The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
940 That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
941 Which heavily he answers with a groan
942 More sharp to me than spurring to his side
943 For that same groan doth put this in my mind
944 My grief lies onward and my joy behind
945 51
946 Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
947 Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
948 From where thou art why should I haste me thence
949 Till I return of posting is no need
950 O what excuse will my poor beast then find
951 When swift extremity can seem but slow
952 Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
953 In winged speed no motion shall I know
954 Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
955 Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made
956 Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
957 But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
958 Since from thee going he went wilfulslow
959 Towards thee I'll run and give him leave to go
960 52
961 So am I as the rich whose blessed key
962 Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure
963 The which he will not every hour survey
964 For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
965 Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
966 Since seldom coming in that long year set
967 Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
968 Or captain jewels in the carcanet
969 So is the time that keeps you as my chest
970 Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
971 To make some special instant specialblest
972 By new unfolding his imprisoned pride
973 Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
974 Being had to triumph being lacked to hope
975 53
976 What is your substance whereof are you made
977 That millions of strange shadows on you tend
978 Since every one hath every one one shade
979 And you but one can every shadow lend
980 Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
981 Is poorly imitated after you
982 On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set
983 And you in Grecian tires are painted new
984 Speak of the spring and foison of the year
985 The one doth shadow of your beauty show
986 The other as your bounty doth appear
987 And you in every blessed shape we know
988 In all external grace you have some part
989 But you like none none you for constant heart
990 54
991 O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
992 By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
993 The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
994 For that sweet odour which doth in it live
995 The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
996 As the perfumed tincture of the roses
997 Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
998 When summer's breath their masked buds discloses
999 But for their virtue only is their show
1000 They live unwooed and unrespected fade
1001 Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
1002 Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
1003 And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
1004 When that shall vade by verse distills your truth
1005 55
1006 Not marble nor the gilded monuments
1007 Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
1008 But you shall shine more bright in these contents
1009 Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
1010 When wasteful war shall statues overturn
1011 And broils root out the work of masonry
1012 Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
1013 The living record of your memory
1014 'Gainst death and alloblivious enmity
1015 Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
1016 Even in the eyes of all posterity
1017 That wear this world out to the ending doom
1018 So till the judgment that your self arise
1019 You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes
1020 56
1021 Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
1022 Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
1023 Which but today by feeding is allayed
1024 Tomorrow sharpened in his former might
1025 So love be thou although today thou fill
1026 Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
1027 Tomorrow see again and do not kill
1028 The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
1029 Let this sad interim like the ocean be
1030 Which parts the shore where two contracted new
1031 Come daily to the banks that when they see
1032 Return of love more blest may be the view
1033 Or call it winter which being full of care
1034 Makes summer's welcome thrice more wished more rare
1035 57
1036 Being your slave what should I do but tend
1037 Upon the hours and times of your desire
1038 I have no precious time at all to spend
1039 Nor services to do till you require
1040 Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour
1041 Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
1042 Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
1043 When you have bid your servant once adieu
1044 Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
1045 Where you may be or your affairs suppose
1046 But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
1047 Save where you are how happy you make those
1048 So true a fool is love that in your will
1049 Though you do any thing he thinks no ill
1050 58
1051 That god forbid that made me first your slave
1052 I should in thought control your times of pleasure
1053 Or at your hand th account of hours to crave
1054 Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
1055 O let me suffer being at your beck
1056 Th imprisoned absence of your liberty
1057 And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
1058 Without accusing you of injury
1059 Be where you list your charter is so strong
1060 That you your self may privilage your time
1061 To what you will to you it doth belong
1062 Your self to pardon of selfdoing crime
1063 I am to wait though waiting so be hell
1064 Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
1065 59
1066 If there be nothing new but that which is
1067 Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
1068 Which labouring for invention bear amis
1069 The second burthen of a former child
1070 O that record could with a backward look
1071 Even of five hundred courses of the sun
1072 Show me your image in some antique book
1073 Since mind at first in character was done
1074 That I might see what the old world could say
1075 To this composed wonder of your frame
1076 Whether we are mended or whether better they
1077 Or whether revolution be the same
1078 O sure I am the wits of former days
1079 To subjects worse have given admiring praise
1080 60
1081 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
1082 So do our minutes hasten to their end
1083 Each changing place with that which goes before
1084 In sequent toil all forwards do contend
1085 Nativity once in the main of light
1086 Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
1087 Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight
1088 And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
1089 Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
1090 And delves the parallels in beauty's brow
1091 Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth
1092 And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
1093 And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
1094 Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
1095 61
1096 Is it thy will thy image should keep open
1097 My heavy eyelids to the weary night
1098 Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
1099 While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
1100 Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
1101 So far from home into my deeds to pry
1102 To find out shames and idle hours in me
1103 The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
1104 O no thy love though much is not so great
1105 It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
1106 Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
1107 To play the watchman ever for thy sake
1108 For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
1109 From me far off with others all too near
1110 62
1111 Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye
1112 And all my soul and all my every part
1113 And for this sin there is no remedy
1114 It is so grounded inward in my heart
1115 Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
1116 No shape so true no truth of such account
1117 And for my self mine own worth do define
1118 As I all other in all worths surmount
1119 But when my glass shows me my self indeed
1120 beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
1121 Mine own selflove quite contrary I read
1122 Self so selfloving were iniquity
1123 'Tis thee my self that for my self I praise
1124 Painting my age with beauty of thy days
1125 63
1126 Against my love shall be as I am now
1127 With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn
1128 When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
1129 With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
1130 Hath travelled on to age's steepy night
1131 And all those beauties whereof now he's king
1132 Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
1133 Stealing away the treasure of his spring
1134 For such a time do I now fortify
1135 Against confounding age's cruel knife
1136 That he shall never cut from memory
1137 My sweet love's beauty though my lover's life
1138 His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
1139 And they shall live and he in them still green
1140 64
1141 When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
1142 The richproud cost of outworn buried age
1143 When sometime lofty towers I see downrased
1144 And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
1145 When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
1146 Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
1147 And the firm soil win of the watery main
1148 Increasing store with loss and loss with store
1149 When I have seen such interchange of State
1150 Or state it self confounded to decay
1151 Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
1152 That Time will come and take my love away
1153 This thought is as a death which cannot choose
1154 But weep to have that which it fears to lose
1155 65
1156 Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
1157 But sad mortality o'ersways their power
1158 How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
1159 Whose action is no stronger than a flower
1160 O how shall summer's honey breath hold out
1161 Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days
1162 When rocks impregnable are not so stout
1163 Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
1164 O fearful meditation where alack
1165 Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid
1166 Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
1167 Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
1168 O none unless this miracle have might
1169 That in black ink my love may still shine bright
1170 66
1171 Tired with all these for restful death I cry
1172 As to behold desert a beggar born
1173 And needy nothing trimmed in jollity
1174 And purest faith unhappily forsworn
1175 And gilded honour shamefully misplaced
1176 And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
1177 And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
1178 And strength by limping sway disabled
1179 And art made tonguetied by authority
1180 And folly doctorlike controlling skill
1181 And simple truth miscalled simplicity
1182 And captive good attending captain ill
1183 Tired with all these from these would I be gone
1184 Save that to die I leave my love alone
1185 67
1186 Ah wherefore with infection should he live
1187 And with his presence grace impiety
1188 That sin by him advantage should achieve
1189 And lace it self with his society
1190 Why should false painting imitate his cheek
1191 And steal dead seeming of his living hue
1192 Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
1193 Roses of shadow since his rose is true
1194 Why should he live now nature bankrupt is
1195 Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
1196 For she hath no exchequer now but his
1197 And proud of many lives upon his gains
1198 O him she stores to show what wealth she had
1199 In days long since before these last so bad
1200 68
1201 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
1202 When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
1203 Before these bastard signs of fair were born
1204 Or durst inhabit on a living brow
1205 Before the golden tresses of the dead
1206 The right of sepulchres were shorn away
1207 To live a second life on second head
1208 Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay
1209 In him those holy antique hours are seen
1210 Without all ornament it self and true
1211 Making no summer of another's green
1212 Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
1213 And him as for a map doth Nature store
1214 To show false Art what beauty was of yore
1215 69
1216 Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
1217 Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
1218 All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
1219 Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
1220 Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
1221 But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
1222 In other accents do this praise confound
1223 By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
1224 They look into the beauty of thy mind
1225 And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
1226 Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
1227 To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
1228 But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
1229 The soil is this that thou dost common grow
1230 70
1231 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
1232 For slander's mark was ever yet the fair
1233 The ornament of beauty is suspect
1234 A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air
1235 So thou be good slander doth but approve
1236 Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
1237 For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
1238 And thou present'st a pure unstained prime
1239 Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
1240 Either not assailed or victor being charged
1241 Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
1242 To tie up envy evermore enlarged
1243 If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
1244 Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
1245 71
1246 No longer mourn for me when I am dead
1247 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1248 Give warning to the world that I am fled
1249 From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
1250 Nay if you read this line remember not
1251 The hand that writ it for I love you so
1252 That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
1253 If thinking on me then should make you woe
1254 O if I say you look upon this verse
1255 When I perhaps compounded am with clay
1256 Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
1257 But let your love even with my life decay
1258 Lest the wise world should look into your moan
1259 And mock you with me after I am gone
1260 72
1261 O lest the world should task you to recite
1262 What merit lived in me that you should love
1263 After my death dear love forget me quite
1264 For you in me can nothing worthy prove
1265 Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
1266 To do more for me than mine own desert
1267 And hang more praise upon deceased I
1268 Than niggard truth would willingly impart
1269 O lest your true love may seem false in this
1270 That you for love speak well of me untrue
1271 My name be buried where my body is
1272 And live no more to shame nor me nor you
1273 For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
1274 And so should you to love things nothing worth
1275 73
1276 That time of year thou mayst in me behold
1277 When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
1278 Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
1279 Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
1280 In me thou seest the twilight of such day
1281 As after sunset fadeth in the west
1282 Which by and by black night doth take away
1283 Death's second self that seals up all in rest
1284 In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
1285 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
1286 As the deathbed whereon it must expire
1287 Consumed with that which it was nourished by
1288 This thou perceiv'st which makes thy love more strong
1289 To love that well which thou must leave ere long
1290 74
1291 But be contented when that fell arrest
1292 Without all bail shall carry me away
1293 My life hath in this line some interest
1294 Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
1295 When thou reviewest this thou dost review
1296 The very part was consecrate to thee
1297 The earth can have but earth which is his due
1298 My spirit is thine the better part of me
1299 So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
1300 The prey of worms my body being dead
1301 The coward conquest of a wretch's knife
1302 Too base of thee to be remembered
1303 The worth of that is that which it contains
1304 And that is this and this with thee remains
1305 75
1306 So are you to my thoughts as food to life
1307 Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground
1308 And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1309 As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found
1310 Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
1311 Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
1312 Now counting best to be with you alone
1313 Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
1314 Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
1315 And by and by clean starved for a look
1316 Possessing or pursuing no delight
1317 Save what is had or must from you be took
1318 Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
1319 Or gluttoning on all or all away
1320 76
1321 Why is my verse so barren of new pride
1322 So far from variation or quick change
1323 Why with the time do I not glance aside
1324 To newfound methods and to compounds strange
1325 Why write I still all one ever the same
1326 And keep invention in a noted weed
1327 That every word doth almost tell my name
1328 Showing their birth and where they did proceed
1329 O know sweet love I always write of you
1330 And you and love are still my argument
1331 So all my best is dressing old words new
1332 Spending again what is already spent
1333 For as the sun is daily new and old
1334 So is my love still telling what is told
1335 77
1336 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
1337 Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
1338 These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear
1339 And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
1340 The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
1341 Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
1342 Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
1343 Time's thievish progress to eternity
1344 Look what thy memory cannot contain
1345 Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
1346 Those children nursed delivered from thy brain
1347 To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
1348 These offices so oft as thou wilt look
1349 Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
1350 78
1351 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
1352 And found such fair assistance in my verse
1353 As every alien pen hath got my use
1354 And under thee their poesy disperse
1355 Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
1356 And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
1357 Have added feathers to the learned's wing
1358 And given grace a double majesty
1359 Yet be most proud of that which I compile
1360 Whose influence is thine and born of thee
1361 In others works thou dost but mend the style
1362 And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
1363 But thou art all my art and dost advance
1364 As high as learning my rude ignorance
1365 79
1366 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
1367 My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
1368 But now my gracious numbers are decayed
1369 And my sick muse doth give an other place
1370 I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
1371 Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
1372 Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
1373 He robs thee of and pays it thee again
1374 He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
1375 From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
1376 And found it in thy cheek he can afford
1377 No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
1378 Then thank him not for that which he doth say
1379 Since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
1380 80
1381 O how I faint when I of you do write
1382 Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
1383 And in the praise thereof spends all his might
1384 To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
1385 But since your worth wide as the ocean is
1386 The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
1387 My saucy bark inferior far to his
1388 On your broad main doth wilfully appear
1389 Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
1390 Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
1391 Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat
1392 He of tall building and of goodly pride
1393 Then if he thrive and I be cast away
1394 The worst was this my love was my decay
1395 81
1396 Or I shall live your epitaph to make
1397 Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
1398 From hence your memory death cannot take
1399 Although in me each part will be forgotten
1400 Your name from hence immortal life shall have
1401 Though I once gone to all the world must die
1402 The earth can yield me but a common grave
1403 When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie
1404 Your monument shall be my gentle verse
1405 Which eyes not yet created shall o'erread
1406 And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
1407 When all the breathers of this world are dead
1408 You still shall live such virtue hath my pen
1409 Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
1410 82
1411 I grant thou wert not married to my muse
1412 And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1413 The dedicated words which writers use
1414 Of their fair subject blessing every book
1415 Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
1416 Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
1417 And therefore art enforced to seek anew
1418 Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
1419 And do so love yet when they have devised
1420 What strained touches rhetoric can lend
1421 Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
1422 In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
1423 And their gross painting might be better used
1424 Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
1425 83
1426 I never saw that you did painting need
1427 And therefore to your fair no painting set
1428 I found or thought I found you did exceed
1429 That barren tender of a poet's debt
1430 And therefore have I slept in your report
1431 That you your self being extant well might show
1432 How far a modern quill doth come too short
1433 Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
1434 This silence for my sin you did impute
1435 Which shall be most my glory being dumb
1436 For I impair not beauty being mute
1437 When others would give life and bring a tomb
1438 There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
1439 Than both your poets can in praise devise
1440 84
1441 Who is it that says most which can say more
1442 Than this rich praise that you alone are you
1443 In whose confine immured is the store
1444 Which should example where your equal grew
1445 Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
1446 That to his subject lends not some small glory
1447 But he that writes of you if he can tell
1448 That you are you so dignifies his story
1449 Let him but copy what in you is writ
1450 Not making worse what nature made so clear
1451 And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
1452 Making his style admired every where
1453 You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
1454 Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
1455 85
1456 My tonguetied muse in manners holds her still
1457 While comments of your praise richly compiled
1458 Reserve their character with golden quill
1459 And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
1460 I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
1461 And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
1462 To every hymn that able spirit affords
1463 In polished form of well refined pen
1464 Hearing you praised I say 'tis so 'tis true
1465 And to the most of praise add something more
1466 But that is in my thought whose love to you
1467 Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
1468 Then others for the breath of words respect
1469 Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
1470 86
1471 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
1472 Bound for the prize of all too precious you
1473 That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
1474 Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
1475 Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
1476 Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
1477 No neither he nor his compeers by night
1478 Giving him aid my verse astonished
1479 He nor that affable familiar ghost
1480 Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
1481 As victors of my silence cannot boast
1482 I was not sick of any fear from thence
1483 But when your countenance filled up his line
1484 Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
1485 87
1486 Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
1487 And like enough thou know'st thy estimate
1488 The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
1489 My bonds in thee are all determinate
1490 For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
1491 And for that riches where is my deserving
1492 The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
1493 And so my patent back again is swerving
1494 Thy self thou gav'st thy own worth then not knowing
1495 Or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking
1496 So thy great gift upon misprision growing
1497 Comes home again on better judgement making
1498 Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
1499 In sleep a king but waking no such matter
1500 88
1501 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
1502 And place my merit in the eye of scorn
1503 Upon thy side against my self I'll fight
1504 And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
1505 With mine own weakness being best acquainted
1506 Upon thy part I can set down a story
1507 Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted
1508 That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
1509 And I by this will be a gainer too
1510 For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
1511 The injuries that to my self I do
1512 Doing thee vantage doublevantage me
1513 Such is my love to thee I so belong
1514 That for thy right my self will bear all wrong
1515 89
1516 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
1517 And I will comment upon that offence
1518 Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
1519 Against thy reasons making no defence
1520 Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
1521 To set a form upon desired change
1522 As I'll my self disgrace knowing thy will
1523 I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
1524 Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
1525 Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
1526 Lest I too much profane should do it wronk
1527 And haply of our old acquaintance tell
1528 For thee against my self I'll vow debate
1529 For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate
1530 90
1531 Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
1532 Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
1533 join with the spite of fortune make me bow
1534 And do not drop in for an afterloss
1535 Ah do not when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow
1536 Come in the rearward of a conquered woe
1537 Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
1538 To linger out a purposed overthrow
1539 If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
1540 When other petty griefs have done their spite
1541 But in the onset come so shall I taste
1542 At first the very worst of fortune's might
1543 And other strains of woe which now seem woe
1544 Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
1545 91
1546 Some glory in their birth some in their skill
1547 Some in their wealth some in their body's force
1548 Some in their garments though newfangled ill
1549 Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
1550 And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
1551 Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
1552 But these particulars are not my measure
1553 All these I better in one general best
1554 Thy love is better than high birth to me
1555 Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
1556 Of more delight than hawks and horses be
1557 And having thee of all men's pride I boast
1558 Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
1559 All this away and me most wretchcd make
1560 92
1561 But do thy worst to steal thy self away
1562 For term of life thou art assured mine
1563 And life no longer than thy love will stay
1564 For it depends upon that love of thine
1565 Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
1566 When in the least of them my life hath end
1567 I see a better state to me belongs
1568 Than that which on thy humour doth depend
1569 Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
1570 Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
1571 O what a happy title do I find
1572 Happy to have thy love happy to die
1573 But what's so blessedfair that fears no blot
1574 Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not
1575 93
1576 So shall I live supposing thou art true
1577 Like a deceived husband so love's face
1578 May still seem love to me though altered new
1579 Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
1580 For there can live no hatred in thine eye
1581 Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
1582 In many's looks the false heart's history
1583 Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
1584 But heaven in thy creation did decree
1585 That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
1586 Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
1587 Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
1588 How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow
1589 If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
1590 94
1591 They that have power to hurt and will do none
1592 That do not do the thing they most do show
1593 Who moving others are themselves as stone
1594 Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
1595 They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
1596 And husband nature's riches from expense
1597 Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
1598 Others but stewards of their excellence
1599 The summer's flower is to the summer sweet
1600 Though to it self it only live and die
1601 But if that flower with base infection meet
1602 The basest weed outbraves his dignity
1603 For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
1604 Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
1605 95
1606 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
1607 Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
1608 Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
1609 O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
1610 That tongue that tells the story of thy days
1611 Making lascivious comments on thy sport
1612 Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
1613 Naming thy name blesses an ill report
1614 O what a mansion have those vices got
1615 Which for their habitation chose out thee
1616 Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot
1617 And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
1618 Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
1619 The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
1620 96
1621 Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
1622 Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
1623 Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
1624 Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort
1625 As on the finger of a throned queen
1626 The basest jewel will be well esteemed
1627 So are those errors that in thee are seen
1628 To truths translated and for true things deemed
1629 How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
1630 If like a lamb he could his looks translate
1631 How many gazers mightst thou lead away
1632 if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
1633 But do not so I love thee in such sort
1634 As thou being mine mine is thy good report
1635 97
1636 How like a winter hath my absence been
1637 From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
1638 What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
1639 What old December's bareness everywhere
1640 And yet this time removed was summer's time
1641 The teeming autumn big with rich increase
1642 Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
1643 Like widowed wombs after their lords decease
1644 Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
1645 But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
1646 For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
1647 And thou away the very birds are mute
1648 Or if they sing 'tis with so dull a cheer
1649 That leaves look pale dreading the winter's near
1650 98
1651 From you have I been absent in the spring
1652 When proudpied April dressed in all his trim
1653 Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
1654 That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him
1655 Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
1656 Of different flowers in odour and in hue
1657 Could make me any summer's story tell
1658 Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
1659 Nor did I wonder at the lily's white
1660 Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
1661 They were but sweet but figures of delight
1662 Drawn after you you pattern of all those
1663 Yet seemed it winter still and you away
1664 As with your shadow I with these did play
1665 99
1666 The forward violet thus did I chide
1667 Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
1668 If not from my love's breath The purple pride
1669 Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
1670 In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed
1671 The lily I condemned for thy hand
1672 And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair
1673 The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
1674 One blushing shame another white despair
1675 A third nor red nor white had stol'n of both
1676 And to his robbery had annexed thy breath
1677 But for his theft in pride of all his growth
1678 A vengeful canker eat him up to death
1679 More flowers I noted yet I none could see
1680 But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee
1681 100
1682 Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long
1683 To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
1684 Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song
1685 Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
1686 Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
1687 In gentle numbers time so idly spent
1688 Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
1689 And gives thy pen both skill and argument
1690 Rise resty Muse my love's sweet face survey
1691 If time have any wrinkle graven there
1692 If any be a satire to decay
1693 And make time's spoils despised everywhere
1694 Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
1695 So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife
1696 101
1697 O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
1698 For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
1699 Both truth and beauty on my love depends
1700 So dost thou too and therein dignified
1701 Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
1702 'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
1703 Beauty no pencil beauty's truth to lay
1704 But best is best if never intermixed'
1705 Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
1706 Excuse not silence so for't lies in thee
1707 To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
1708 And to be praised of ages yet to be
1709 Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
1710 To make him seem long hence as he shows now
1711 102
1712 My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
1713 I love not less though less the show appear
1714 That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
1715 The owner's tongue doth publish every where
1716 Our love was new and then but in the spring
1717 When I was wont to greet it with my lays
1718 As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
1719 And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
1720 Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1721 Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
1722 But that wild music burthens every bough
1723 And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
1724 Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
1725 Because I would not dull you with my song
1726 103
1727 Alack what poverty my muse brings forth
1728 That having such a scope to show her pride
1729 The argument all bare is of more worth
1730 Than when it hath my added praise beside
1731 O blame me not if I no more can write
1732 Look in your glass and there appears a face
1733 That overgoes my blunt invention quite
1734 Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
1735 Were it not sinful then striving to mend
1736 To mar the subject that before was well
1737 For to no other pass my verses tend
1738 Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
1739 And more much more than in my verse can sit
1740 Your own glass shows you when you look in it
1741 104
1742 To me fair friend you never can be old
1743 For as you were when first your eye I eyed
1744 Such seems your beauty still three winters cold
1745 Have from the forests shook three summers pride
1746 Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
1747 In process of the seasons have I seen
1748 Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned
1749 Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
1750 Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
1751 Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
1752 So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
1753 Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
1754 For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
1755 Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead
1756 105
1757 Let not my love be called idolatry
1758 Nor my beloved as an idol show
1759 Since all alike my songs and praises be
1760 To one of one still such and ever so
1761 Kind is my love today tomorrow kind
1762 Still constant in a wondrous excellence
1763 Therefore my verse to constancy confined
1764 One thing expressing leaves out difference
1765 Fair kind and true is all my argument
1766 Fair kind and true varying to other words
1767 And in this change is my invention spent
1768 Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
1769 Fair kind and true have often lived alone
1770 Which three till now never kept seat in one
1771 106
1772 When in the chronicle of wasted time
1773 I see descriptions of the fairest wights
1774 And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
1775 In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
1776 Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
1777 Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
1778 I see their antique pen would have expressed
1779 Even such a beauty as you master now
1780 So all their praises are but prophecies
1781 Of this our time all you prefiguring
1782 And for they looked but with divining eyes
1783 They had not skill enough your worth to sing
1784 For we which now behold these present days
1785 Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
1786 107
1787 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
1788 Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
1789 Can yet the lease of my true love control
1790 Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
1791 The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
1792 And the sad augurs mock their own presage
1793 Incertainties now crown themselves assured
1794 And peace proclaims olives of endless age
1795 Now with the drops of this most balmy time
1796 My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
1797 Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme
1798 While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
1799 And thou in this shalt find thy monument
1800 When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
1801 108
1802 What's in the brain that ink may character
1803 Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
1804 What's new to speak what now to register
1805 That may express my love or thy dear merit
1806 Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
1807 I must each day say o'er the very same
1808 Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
1809 Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name
1810 So that eternal love in love's fresh case
1811 Weighs not the dust and injury of age
1812 Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
1813 But makes antiquity for aye his page
1814 Finding the first conceit of love there bred
1815 Where time and outward form would show it dead
1816 109
1817 O never say that I was false of heart
1818 Though absence seemed my flame to qualify
1819 As easy might I from my self depart
1820 As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
1821 That is my home of love if I have ranged
1822 Like him that travels I return again
1823 Just to the time not with the time exchanged
1824 So that my self bring water for my stain
1825 Never believe though in my nature reigned
1826 All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
1827 That it could so preposterously be stained
1828 To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
1829 For nothing this wide universe I call
1830 Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
1831 110
1832 Alas 'tis true I have gone here and there
1833 And made my self a motley to the view
1834 Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
1835 Made old offences of affections new
1836 Most true it is that I have looked on truth
1837 Askance and strangely but by all above
1838 These blenches gave my heart another youth
1839 And worse essays proved thee my best of love
1840 Now all is done have what shall have no end
1841 Mine appetite I never more will grind
1842 On newer proof to try an older friend
1843 A god in love to whom I am confined
1844 Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
1845 Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
1846 111
1847 O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
1848 The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
1849 That did not better for my life provide
1850 Than public means which public manners breeds
1851 Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
1852 And almost thence my nature is subdued
1853 To what it works in like the dyer's hand
1854 Pity me then and wish I were renewed
1855 Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
1856 Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
1857 No bitterness that I will bitter think
1858 Nor double penance to correct correction
1859 Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
1860 Even that your pity is enough to cure me
1861 112
1862 Your love and pity doth th impression fill
1863 Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
1864 For what care I who calls me well or ill
1865 So you o'ergreen my bad my good allow
1866 You are my all the world and I must strive
1867 To know my shames and praises from your tongue
1868 None else to me nor I to none alive
1869 That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
1870 In so profound abysm I throw all care
1871 Of others voices that my adder's sense
1872 To critic and to flatterer stopped are
1873 Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
1874 You are so strongly in my purpose bred
1875 That all the world besides methinks are dead
1876 113
1877 Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
1878 And that which governs me to go about
1879 Doth part his function and is partly blind
1880 Seems seeing but effectually is out
1881 For it no form delivers to the heart
1882 Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
1883 Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
1884 Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
1885 For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight
1886 The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
1887 The mountain or the sea the day or night
1888 The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
1889 Incapable of more replete with you
1890 My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
1891 114
1892 Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
1893 Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery
1894 Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
1895 And that your love taught it this alchemy
1896 To make of monsters and things indigest
1897 Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
1898 Creating every bad a perfect best
1899 As fast as objects to his beams assemble
1900 O 'tis the first 'tis flattery in my seeing
1901 And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
1902 Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing
1903 And to his palate doth prepare the cup
1904 If it be poisoned 'tis the lesser sin
1905 That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
1906 115
1907 Those lines that I before have writ do lie
1908 Even those that said I could not love you dearer
1909 Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
1910 My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
1911 But reckoning time whose millioned accidents
1912 Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings
1913 Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents
1914 Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things
1915 Alas why fearing of time's tyranny
1916 Might I not then say 'Now I love you best'
1917 When I was certain o'er incertainty
1918 Crowning the present doubting of the rest
1919 Love is a babe then might I not say so
1920 To give full growth to that which still doth grow
1921 116
1922 Let me not to the marriage of true minds
1923 Admit impediments love is not love
1924 Which alters when it alteration finds
1925 Or bends with the remover to remove
1926 O no it is an everfixed mark
1927 That looks on tempests and is never shaken
1928 It is the star to every wand'ring bark
1929 Whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
1930 Love's not Time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks
1931 Within his bending sickle's compass come
1932 Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
1933 But bears it out even to the edge of doom
1934 If this be error and upon me proved
1935 I never writ nor no man ever loved
1936 117
1937 Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
1938 Wherein I should your great deserts repay
1939 Forgot upon your dearest love to call
1940 Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
1941 That I have frequent been with unknown minds
1942 And given to time your own dearpurchased right
1943 That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
1944 Which should transport me farthest from your sight
1945 Book both my wilfulness and errors down
1946 And on just proof surmise accumulate
1947 Bring me within the level of your frown
1948 But shoot not at me in your wakened hate
1949 Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
1950 The constancy and virtue of your love
1951 118
1952 Like as to make our appetite more keen
1953 With eager compounds we our palate urge
1954 As to prevent our maladies unseen
1955 We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
1956 Even so being full of your ne'ercloying sweetness
1957 To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
1958 And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
1959 To be diseased ere that there was true needing
1960 Thus policy in love t anticipate
1961 The ills that were not grew to faults assured
1962 And brought to medicine a healthful state
1963 Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
1964 But thence I learn and find the lesson true
1965 Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
1966 119
1967 What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
1968 Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
1969 Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
1970 Still losing when I saw my self to win
1971 What wretched errors hath my heart committed
1972 Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
1973 How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
1974 In the distraction of this madding fever
1975 O benefit of ill now I find true
1976 That better is by evil still made better
1977 And ruined love when it is built anew
1978 Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
1979 So I return rebuked to my content
1980 And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent
1981 120
1982 That you were once unkind befriends me now
1983 And for that sorrow which I then did feel
1984 Needs must I under my transgression bow
1985 Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
1986 For if you were by my unkindness shaken
1987 As I by yours y'have passed a hell of time
1988 And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
1989 To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
1990 O that our night of woe might have remembered
1991 My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
1992 And soon to you as you to me then tendered
1993 The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
1994 But that your trespass now becomes a fee
1995 Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
1996 121
1997 'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
1998 When not to be receives reproach of being
1999 And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
2000 Not by our feeling but by others seeing
2001 For why should others false adulterate eyes
2002 Give salutation to my sportive blood
2003 Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
2004 Which in their wills count bad what I think good
2005 No I am that I am and they that level
2006 At my abuses reckon up their own
2007 I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
2008 By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
2009 Unless this general evil they maintain
2010 All men are bad and in their badness reign
2011 122
2012 Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
2013 Full charactered with lasting memory
2014 Which shall above that idle rank remain
2015 Beyond all date even to eternity
2016 Or at the least so long as brain and heart
2017 Have faculty by nature to subsist
2018 Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
2019 Of thee thy record never can be missed
2020 That poor retention could not so much hold
2021 Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
2022 Therefore to give them from me was I bold
2023 To trust those tables that receive thee more
2024 To keep an adjunct to remember thee
2025 Were to import forgetfulness in me
2026 123
2027 No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
2028 Thy pyramids built up with newer might
2029 To me are nothing novel nothing strange
2030 They are but dressings Of a former sight
2031 Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
2032 What thou dost foist upon us that is old
2033 And rather make them born to our desire
2034 Than think that we before have heard them told
2035 Thy registers and thee I both defy
2036 Not wond'ring at the present nor the past
2037 For thy records and what we see doth lie
2038 Made more or less by thy continual haste
2039 This I do vow and this shall ever be
2040 I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
2041 124
2042 If my dear love were but the child of state
2043 It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered
2044 As subject to time's love or to time's hate
2045 Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
2046 No it was builded far from accident
2047 It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
2048 Under the blow of thralled discontent
2049 Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls
2050 It fears not policy that heretic
2051 Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours
2052 But all alone stands hugely politic
2053 That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
2054 To this I witness call the fools of time
2055 Which die for goodness who have lived for crime
2056 125
2057 Were't aught to me I bore the canopy
2058 With my extern the outward honouring
2059 Or laid great bases for eternity
2060 Which proves more short than waste or ruining
2061 Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
2062 Lose all and more by paying too much rent
2063 For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
2064 Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
2065 No let me be obsequious in thy heart
2066 And take thou my oblation poor but free
2067 Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
2068 But mutual render only me for thee
2069 Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
2070 When most impeached stands least in thy control
2071 126
2072 O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
2073 Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour
2074 Who hast by waning grown and therein show'st
2075 Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st
2076 If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
2077 As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
2078 She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
2079 May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
2080 Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
2081 She may detain but not still keep her treasure
2082 Her audit though delayed answered must be
2083 And her quietus is to render thee
2084 127
2085 In the old age black was not counted fair
2086 Or if it were it bore not beauty's name
2087 But now is black beauty's successive heir
2088 And beauty slandered with a bastard shame
2089 For since each hand hath put on nature's power
2090 Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face
2091 Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
2092 But is profaned if not lives in disgrace
2093 Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black
2094 Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
2095 At such who not born fair no beauty lack
2096 Slandering creation with a false esteem
2097 Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
2098 That every tongue says beauty should look so
2099 128
2100 How oft when thou my music music play'st
2101 Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
2102 With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
2103 The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
2104 Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
2105 To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
2106 Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
2107 At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand
2108 To be so tickled they would change their state
2109 And situation with those dancing chips
2110 O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
2111 Making dead wood more blest than living lips
2112 Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
2113 Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
2114 129
2115 Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame
2116 Is lust in action and till action lust
2117 Is perjured murd'rous bloody full of blame
2118 Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
2119 Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
2120 Past reason hunted and no sooner had
2121 Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
2122 On purpose laid to make the taker mad
2123 Mad in pursuit and in possession so
2124 Had having and in quest to have extreme
2125 A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
2126 Before a joy proposed behind a dream
2127 All this the world well knows yet none knows well
2128 To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
2129 130
2130 My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
2131 Coral is far more red than her lips red
2132 If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
2133 If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
2134 I have seen roses damasked red and white
2135 But no such roses see I in her cheeks
2136 And in some perfumes is there more delight
2137 Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
2138 I love to hear her speak yet well I know
2139 That music hath a far more pleasing sound
2140 I grant I never saw a goddess go
2141 My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
2142 And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
2143 As any she belied with false compare
2144 131
2145 Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
2146 As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
2147 For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
2148 Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
2149 Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
2150 Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
2151 To say they err I dare not be so bold
2152 Although I swear it to my self alone
2153 And to be sure that is not false I swear
2154 A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
2155 One on another's neck do witness bear
2156 Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place
2157 In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
2158 And thence this slander as I think proceeds

2160 Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
2161 Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
2162 Have put on black and loving mourners be
2163 Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
2164 And truly not the morning sun of heaven
2165 Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
2166 Nor that full star that ushers in the even
2167 Doth half that glory to the sober west
2168 As those two mourning eyes become thy face
2169 O let it then as well beseem thy heart
2170 To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
2171 And suit thy pity like in every part
2172 Then will I swear beauty herself is black
2173 And all they foul that thy complexion lack
2174 133
2175 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
2176 For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
2177 Is't not enough to torture me alone
2178 But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
2179 Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
2180 And my next self thou harder hast engrossed
2181 Of him my self and thee I am forsaken
2182 A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed
2183 Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward
2184 But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail
2185 Whoe'er keeps me let my heart be his guard
2186 Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
2187 And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
2188 Perforce am thine and all that is in me
2189 134
2190 So now I have confessed that he is thine
2191 And I my self am mortgaged to thy will
2192 My self I'll forfeit so that other mine
2193 Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
2194 But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
2195 For thou art covetous and he is kind
2196 He learned but suretylike to write for me
2197 Under that bond that him as fist doth bind
2198 The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
2199 Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
2200 And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
2201 So him I lose through my unkind abuse
2202 Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
2203 He pays the whole and yet am I not free
2204 135
2205 Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
2206 And 'Will to boot and 'Will in overplus
2207 More than enough am I that vex thee still
2208 To thy sweet will making addition thus
2209 Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
2210 Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
2211 Shall will in others seem right gracious
2212 And in my will no fair acceptance shine
2213 The sea all water yet receives rain still
2214 And in abundance addeth to his store
2215 So thou being rich in will add to thy will
2216 One will of mine to make thy large will more
2217 Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
2218 Think all but one and me in that one 'Will'
2219 136
2220 If thy soul check thee that I come so near
2221 Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will'
2222 And will thy soul knows is admitted there
2223 Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
2224 'Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
2225 Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
2226 In things of great receipt with case we prove
2227 Among a number one is reckoned none
2228 Then in the number let me pass untold
2229 Though in thy store's account I one must be
2230 For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
2231 That nothing me a something sweet to thee
2232 Make but my name thy love and love that still
2233 And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will
2234 137
2235 Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
2236 That they behold and see not what they see
2237 They know what beauty is see where it lies
2238 Yet what the best is take the worst to be
2239 If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
2240 Be anchored in the bay where all men ride
2241 Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
2242 Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
2243 Why should my heart think that a several plot
2244 Which my heart knows the wide world's common place
2245 Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
2246 To put fair truth upon so foul a face
2247 In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
2248 And to this false plague are they now transferred
2249 138
2250 When my love swears that she is made of truth
2251 I do believe her though I know she lies
2252 That she might think me some untutored youth
2253 Unlearned in the world's false subtleties
2254 Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
2255 Although she knows my days are past the best
2256 Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue
2257 On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
2258 But wherefore says she not she is unjust
2259 And wherefore say not I that I am old
2260 O love's best habit is in seeming trust
2261 And age in love loves not to have years told
2262 Therefore I lie with her and she with me
2263 And in our faults by lies we flattered be
2264 139
2265 O call not me to justify the wrong
2266 That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
2267 Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
2268 Use power with power and slay me not by art
2269 Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere but in my sight
2270 Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
2271 What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
2272 Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide
2273 Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
2274 Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
2275 And therefore from my face she turns my foes
2276 That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
2277 Yet do not so but since I am near slain
2278 Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
2279 140
2280 Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
2281 My tonguetied patience with too much disdain
2282 Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
2283 The manner of my pitywanting pain
2284 If I might teach thee wit better it were
2285 Though not to love yet love to tell me so
2286 As testy sick men when their deaths be near
2287 No news but health from their physicians know
2288 For if I should despair I should grow mad
2289 And in my madness might speak ill of thee
2290 Now this illwresting world is grown so bad
2291 Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
2292 That I may not be so nor thou belied
2293 Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
2294 141
2295 In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
2296 For they in thee a thousand errors note
2297 But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise
2298 Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
2299 Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted
2300 Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
2301 Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
2302 To any sensual feast with thee alone
2303 But my five wits nor my five senses can
2304 Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
2305 Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
2306 Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be
2307 Only my plague thus far I count my gain
2308 That she that makes me sin awards me pain
2309 142
2310 Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
2311 Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
2312 O but with mine compare thou thine own state
2313 And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
2314 Or if it do not from those lips of thine
2315 That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
2316 And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
2317 Robbed others beds revenues of their rents
2318 Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those
2319 Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
2320 Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
2321 Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
2322 If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
2323 By selfexample mayst thou be denied
2324 143
2325 Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
2326 One of her feathered creatures broke away
2327 Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
2328 In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
2329 Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
2330 Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
2331 To follow that which flies before her face
2332 Not prizing her poor infant's discontent
2333 So run'st thou after that which flies from thee
2334 Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
2335 But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
2336 And play the mother's part kiss me be kind
2337 So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
2338 If thou turn back and my loud crying still
2339 144
2340 Two loves I have of comfort and despair
2341 Which like two spirits do suggest me still
2342 The better angel is a man right fair
2343 The worser spirit a woman coloured ill
2344 To win me soon to hell my female evil
2345 Tempteth my better angel from my side
2346 And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
2347 Wooing his purity with her foul pride
2348 And whether that my angel be turned fiend
2349 Suspect I may yet not directly tell
2350 But being both from me both to each friend
2351 I guess one angel in another's hell
2352 Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt
2353 Till my bad angel fire my good one out
2354 145
2355 Those lips that Love's own hand did make
2356 Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
2357 To me that languished for her sake
2358 But when she saw my woeful state
2359 Straight in her heart did mercy come
2360 Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
2361 Was used in giving gentle doom
2362 And taught it thus anew to greet
2363 'I hate she altered with an end
2364 That followed it as gentle day
2365 Doth follow night who like a fiend
2366 From heaven to hell is flown away
2367 'I hate from hate away she threw
2368 And saved my life saying 'not you'
2369 146
2370 Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
2371 My sinful earth these rebel powers array
2372 Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
2373 Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
2374 Why so large cost having so short a lease
2375 Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
2376 Shall worms inheritors of this excess
2377 Eat up thy charge is this thy body's end
2378 Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss
2379 And let that pine to aggravate thy store
2380 Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
2381 Within be fed without be rich no more
2382 So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
2383 And death once dead there's no more dying then
2384 147
2385 My love is as a fever longing still
2386 For that which longer nurseth the disease
2387 Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
2388 Th uncertain sickly appetite to please
2389 My reason the physician to my love
2390 Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
2391 Hath left me and I desperate now approve
2392 Desire is death which physic did except
2393 Past cure I am now reason is past care
2394 And franticmad with evermore unrest
2395 My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are
2396 At random from the truth vainly expressed
2397 For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
2398 Who art as black as hell as dark as night
2399 148
2400 O me what eyes hath love put in my head
2401 Which have no correspondence with true sight
2402 Or if they have where is my judgment fled
2403 That censures falsely what they see aright
2404 If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
2405 What means the world to say it is not so
2406 If it be not then love doth well denote
2407 Love's eye is not so true as all men's no
2408 How can it O how can love's eye be true
2409 That is so vexed with watching and with tears
2410 No marvel then though I mistake my view
2411 The sun it self sees not till heaven clears
2412 O cunning love with tears thou keep'st me blind
2413 Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find
2414 149
2415 Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
2416 When I against my self with thee partake
2417 Do I not think on thee when I forgot
2418 Am of my self alltyrant for thy sake
2419 Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
2420 On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon
2421 Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
2422 Revenge upon my self with present moan
2423 What merit do I in my self respect
2424 That is so proud thy service to despise
2425 When all my best doth worship thy defect
2426 Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
2427 But love hate on for now I know thy mind
2428 Those that can see thou lov'st and I am blind
2429 150
2430 O from what power hast thou this powerful might
2431 With insufficiency my heart to sway
2432 To make me give the lie to my true sight
2433 And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
2434 Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
2435 That in the very refuse of thy deeds
2436 There is such strength and warrantise of skill
2437 That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
2438 Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
2439 The more I hear and see just cause of hate
2440 O though I love what others do abhor
2441 With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
2442 If thy unworthiness raised love in me
2443 More worthy I to be beloved of thee
2444 151
2445 Love is too young to know what conscience is
2446 Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
2447 Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
2448 Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
2449 For thou betraying me I do betray
2450 My nobler part to my gross body's treason
2451 My soul doth tell my body that he may
2452 Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
2453 But rising at thy name doth point out thee
2454 As his triumphant prize proud of this pride
2455 He is contented thy poor drudge to be
2456 To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
2457 No want of conscience hold it that I call
2458 Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
2459 152
2460 In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn
2461 But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
2462 In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn
2463 In vowing new hate after new love bearing
2464 But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
2465 When I break twenty I am perjured most
2466 For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
2467 And all my honest faith in thee is lost
2468 For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
2469 Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
2470 And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
2471 Or made them swear against the thing they see
2472 For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I
2473 To swear against the truth so foul a be
2474 153
2475 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
2476 A maid of Dian's this advantage found
2477 And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep
2478 In a cold valleyfountain of that ground
2479 Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love
2480 A dateless lively heat still to endure
2481 And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
2482 Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
2483 But at my mistress eye Love's brand newfired
2484 The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
2485 I sick withal the help of bath desired
2486 And thither hied a sad distempered guest
2487 But found no cure the bath for my help lies
2488 Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes
2489 154
2490 The little Lovegod lying once asleep
2491 Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand
2492 Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
2493 Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
2494 The fairest votary took up that fire
2495 Which many legions of true hearts had warmed
2496 And so the general of hot desire
2497 Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
2498 This brand she quenched in a cool well by
2499 Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual
2500 Growing a bath and healthful remedy
2501 For men discased but I my mistress thrall
2502 Came there for cure and this by that I prove
2503 Love's fire heats water water cools not love

2544 Rousillon The COUNT'S palace
2545 Enter BERTRAM the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON HELENA and LAFEU all in black
2546 COUNTESS In delivering my son from me I bury a second husband
2547 BERTRAM And I in going madam weep o'er my father's death anew
2548 but I must attend his Majesty's command to whom I am now in
2549 ward evermore in subjection
2550 LAFEU You shall find of the King a husband madam you sir a
2551 father He that so generally is at all times good must of
2552 necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it
2553 up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such
2554 abundance
2555 COUNTESS What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment
2556 LAFEU He hath abandon'd his physicians madam under whose
2557 practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other
2558 advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time
2559 COUNTESS This young gentlewoman had a father O that 'had how
2560 sad a passage 'tiswhose skill was almost as great as his
2561 honesty had it stretch'd so far would have made nature
2562 immortal and death should have play for lack of work Would for
2563 the King's sake he were living I think it would be the death of
2564 the King's disease
2565 LAFEU How call'd you the man you speak of madam
2566 COUNTESS He was famous sir in his profession and it was his
2567 great right to be so Gerard de Narbon
2568 LAFEU He was excellent indeed madam the King very lately spoke
2569 of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have
2570 liv'd still if knowledge could be set up against mortality
2571 BERTRAM What is it my good lord the King languishes of
2572 LAFEU A fistula my lord
2573 BERTRAM I heard not of it before
2574 LAFEU I would it were not notorious Was this gentlewoman the
2575 daughter of Gerard de Narbon
2576 COUNTESS His sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
2577 overlooking I have those hopes of her good that her education
2578 promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts
2579 fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities
2580 there commendations go with pitythey are virtues and traitors
2581 too In her they are the better for their simpleness she derives
2582 her honesty and achieves her goodness
2583 LAFEU Your commendations madam get from her tears
2584 COUNTESS 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in
2585 The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
2586 tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek No
2587 more of this Helena go to no more lest it be rather thought
2588 you affect a sorrow than to have
2589 HELENA I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too
2590 LAFEU Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive
2591 grief the enemy to the living
2592 COUNTESS If the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it
2593 soon mortal
2594 BERTRAM Madam I desire your holy wishes
2595 LAFEU How understand we that
2596 COUNTESS Be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father
2597 In manners as in shape Thy blood and virtue
2598 Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
2599 Share with thy birthright Love all trust a few
2600 Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
2601 Rather in power than use and keep thy friend
2602 Under thy own life's key be check'd for silence
2603 But never tax'd for speech What heaven more will
2604 That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
2605 Fall on thy head Farewell My lord
2606 'Tis an unseason'd courtier good my lord
2607 Advise him
2608 LAFEU He cannot want the best
2609 That shall attend his love
2610 COUNTESS Heaven bless him Farewell Bertram Exit
2611 BERTRAM The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
2612 servants to you [To HELENA] Be comfortable to my mother your
2613 mistress and make much of her
2614 LAFEU Farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your
2615 father Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
2616 HELENA O were that all I think not on my father
2617 And these great tears grace his remembrance more
2618 Than those I shed for him What was he like
2619 I have forgot him my imagination
2620 Carries no favour in't but Bertram's
2621 I am undone there is no living none
2622 If Bertram be away 'Twere all one
2623 That I should love a bright particular star
2624 And think to wed it he is so above me
2625 In his bright radiance and collateral light
2626 Must I be comforted not in his sphere
2627 Th ambition in my love thus plagues itself
2628 The hind that would be mated by the lion
2629 Must die for love 'Twas pretty though a plague
2630 To see him every hour to sit and draw
2631 His arched brows his hawking eye his curls
2632 In our heart's tableheart too capable
2633 Of every line and trick of his sweet favour
2634 But now he's gone and my idolatrous fancy
2635 Must sanctify his relics Who comes here
2636 Enter PAROLLES
2637 [Aside] One that goes with him I love him for his sake
2638 And yet I know him a notorious liar
2639 Think him a great way fool solely a coward
2640 Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
2641 That they take place when virtue's steely bones
2642 Looks bleak i th cold wind withal full oft we see
2643 Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
2644 PAROLLES Save you fair queen
2645 HELENA And you monarch
2646 PAROLLES No
2647 HELENA And no
2648 PAROLLES Are you meditating on virginity
2649 HELENA Ay You have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a
2650 question Man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it
2651 against him
2652 PAROLLES Keep him out
2653 HELENA But he assails and our virginity though valiant in the
2654 defence yet is weak Unfold to us some warlike resistance
2655 PAROLLES There is none Man setting down before you will
2656 undermine you and blow you up
2657 HELENA Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowersup
2658 Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men
2659 PAROLLES Virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown
2660 up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves
2661 made you lose your city It is not politic in the commonwealth
2662 of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational
2663 increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
2664 lost That you were made of is metal to make virgins Virginity
2665 by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it
2666 is ever lost 'Tis too cold a companion away with't
2667 HELENA I will stand for 't a little though therefore I die a
2668 virgin
2669 PAROLLES There's little can be said in 't 'tis against the rule
2670 of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
2671 mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs
2672 himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be
2673 buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
2674 offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a
2675 cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with
2676 feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud
2677 idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the
2678 canon Keep it not you cannot choose but lose by't Out with't
2679 Within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly
2680 increase and the principal itself not much the worse Away
2681 with't
2682 HELENA How might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
2683 PAROLLES Let me see Marry ill to like him that ne'er it likes
2684 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept
2685 the less worth Off with't while 'tis vendible answer the time
2686 of request Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of
2687 fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and
2688 the toothpick which wear not now Your date is better in your
2689 pie and your porridge than in your cheek And your virginity
2690 your old virginity is like one of our French wither'd pears it
2691 looks ill it eats drily marry 'tis a wither'd pear it was
2692 formerly better marry yet 'tis a wither'd pear Will you
2693 anything with it
2694 HELENA Not my virginity yet
2695 There shall your master have a thousand loves
2696 A mother and a mistress and a friend
2697 A phoenix captain and an enemy
2698 A guide a goddess and a sovereign
2699 A counsellor a traitress and a dear
2700 His humble ambition proud humility
2701 His jarring concord and his discord dulcet
2702 His faith his sweet disaster with a world
2703 Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
2704 That blinking Cupid gossips Now shall he
2705 I know not what he shall God send him well
2706 The court's a learningplace and he is one
2707 PAROLLES What one i faith
2708 HELENA That I wish well 'Tis pity
2709 PAROLLES What's pity
2710 HELENA That wishing well had not a body in't
2711 Which might be felt that we the poorer born
2712 Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
2713 Might with effects of them follow our friends
2714 And show what we alone must think which never
2715 Returns us thanks

2728 PAROLLES Why think you so
2729 HELENA You go so much backward when you fight
2730 PAROLLES That's for advantage
2731 HELENA So is running away when fear proposes the safety but the
2732 composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
2733 a good wing and I like the wear well
2734 PAROLLES I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely I

2748 That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
2749 The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
2750 To join like likes and kiss like native things
2751 Impossible be strange attempts to those

2761 KING The Florentines and Senoys are by th ears
2762 Have fought with equal fortune and continue
2763 A braving war
2764 FIRST LORD So 'tis reported sir
2765 KING Nay 'tis most credible We here receive it
2766 A certainty vouch'd from our cousin Austria
2767 With caution that the Florentine will move us
2768 For speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
2769 Prejudicates the business and would seem
2770 To have us make denial
2771 FIRST LORD His love and wisdom
2772 Approv'd so to your Majesty may plead
2773 For amplest credence
2774 KING He hath arm'd our answer
2775 And Florence is denied before he comes
2776 Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
2777 The Tuscan service freely have they leave
2778 To stand on either part
2779 SECOND LORD It well may serve
2780 A nursery to our gentry who are sick
2781 For breathing and exploit
2782 KING What's he comes here
2783 Enter BERTRAM LAFEU and PAROLLES
2784 FIRST LORD It is the Count Rousillon my good lord
2785 Young Bertram
2786 KING Youth thou bear'st thy father's face
2787 Frank nature rather curious than in haste
2788 Hath well compos'd thee Thy father's moral parts
2789 Mayst thou inherit too Welcome to Paris
2790 BERTRAM My thanks and duty are your Majesty's
2791 KING I would I had that corporal soundness now
2792 As when thy father and myself in friendship
2793 First tried our soldiership He did look far
2794 Into the service of the time and was
2795 Discipled of the bravest He lasted long
2796 But on us both did haggish age steal on
2797 And wore us out of act It much repairs me
2798 To talk of your good father In his youth
2799 He had the wit which I can well observe
2800 Today in our young lords but they may jest
2801 Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
2802 Ere they can hide their levity in honour
2803 So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
2804 Were in his pride or sharpness if they were
2805 His equal had awak'd them and his honour
2806 Clock to itself knew the true minute when
2807 Exception bid him speak and at this time
2808 His tongue obey'd his hand Who were below him
2809 He us'd as creatures of another place
2810 And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
2811 Making them proud of his humility
2812 In their poor praise he humbled Such a man
2813 Might be a copy to these younger times
2814 Which followed well would demonstrate them now
2815 But goers backward
2816 BERTRAM His good remembrance sir
2817 Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
2818 So in approof lives not his epitaph
2819 As in your royal speech
2820 KING Would I were with him He would always say
2821 Methinks I hear him now his plausive words
2822 He scatter'd not in ears but grafted them
2823 To grow there and to bear 'Let me not live'
2824 This his good melancholy oft began
2825 On the catastrophe and heel of pastime
2826 When it was out'Let me not live quoth he
2827 'After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff
2828 Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
2829 All but new things disdain whose judgments are
2830 Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
2831 Expire before their fashions This he wish'd
2832 I after him do after him wish too
2833 Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home
2834 I quickly were dissolved from my hive
2835 To give some labourers room

2958 Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
2959 Our blood to us this to our blood is born
2960 It is the show and seal of nature's truth

3033 Be not offended for it hurts not him
3034 That he is lov'd of me I follow him not
3035 By any token of presumptuous suit
3036 Nor would I have him till I do deserve him
3037 Yet never know how that desert should be
3038 I know I love in vain strive against hope
3039 Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
3040 I still pour in the waters of my love
3041 And lack not to lose still Thus Indianlike
3042 Religious in mine error I adore
3043 The sun that looks upon his worshipper
3044 But knows of him no more My dearest madam
3045 Let not your hate encounter with my love
3046 For loving where you do but if yourself
3047 Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
3048 Did ever in so true a flame of liking
3049 Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
3050 Was both herself and Love O then give pity
3051 To her whose state is such that cannot choose
3052 But lend and give where she is sure to lose
3053 That seeks not to find that her search implies
3054 But riddlelike lives sweetly where she dies
3055 COUNTESS Had you not lately an intentspeak truly
3056 To go to Paris

3058 COUNTESS Wherefore Tell true
3059 HELENA I will tell truth by grace itself I swear
3060 You know my father left me some prescriptions
3061 Of rare and prov'd effects such as his reading
3062 And manifest experience had collected
3063 For general sovereignty and that he will'd me
3064 In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
3065 As notes whose faculties inclusive were
3066 More than they were in note Amongst the rest
3067 There is a remedy approv'd set down
3068 To cure the desperate languishings whereof
3069 The King is render'd lost
3070 COUNTESS This was your motive
3071 For Paris was it Speak
3072 HELENA My lord your son made me to think of this
3073 Else Paris and the medicine and the King
3074 Had from the conversation of my thoughts
3075 Haply been absent then
3076 COUNTESS But think you Helen
3077 If you should tender your supposed aid
3078 He would receive it He and his physicians
3079 Are of a mind he that they cannot help him
3080 They that they cannot help How shall they credit
3081 A poor unlearned virgin when the schools
3082 Embowell'd of their doctrine have let off
3083 The danger to itself
3084 HELENA There's something in't
3085 More than my father's skill which was the great'st
3086 Of his profession that his good receipt
3087 Shall for my legacy be sanctified
3088 By th luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour
3089 But give me leave to try success I'd venture
3090 The welllost life of mine on his Grace's cure
3091 By such a day and hour
3092 COUNTESS Dost thou believe't
3093 HELENA Ay madam knowingly
3094 COUNTESS Why Helen thou shalt have my leave and love
3095 Means and attendants and my loving greetings
3096 To those of mine in court I'll stay at home
3097 And pray God's blessing into thy attempt
3098 Be gone tomorrow and be sure of this
3099 What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss Exeunt

3177 KING I'll fee thee to stand up
3178 LAFEU Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon
3179 I would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy
3180 And that at my bidding you could so stand up

3187 LAFEU O will you eat
3188 No grapes my royal fox Yes but you will
3189 My noble grapes an if my royal fox
3190 Could reach them I have seen a medicine
3191 That's able to breathe life into a stone
3192 Quicken a rock and make you dance canary
3193 With spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
3194 Is powerful to araise King Pepin nay
3195 To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
3196 And write to her a loveline
3197 KING What her is this
3198 LAFEU Why Doctor She My lord there's one arriv'd
3199 If you will see her Now by my faith and honour
3200 If seriously I may convey my thoughts
3201 In this my light deliverance I have spoke
3202 With one that in her sex her years profession
3203 Wisdom and constancy hath amaz'd me more
3204 Than I dare blame my weakness Will you see her
3205 For that is her demand and know her business
3206 That done laugh well at me
3207 KING Now good Lafeu
3208 Bring in the admiration that we with the
3209 May spend our wonder too or take off thine
3210 By wond'ring how thou took'st it
3211 LAFEU Nay I'll fit you

3213 KING Thus he his special nothing ever prologues
3214 Reenter LAFEU with HELENA
3215 LAFEU Nay come your ways
3216 KING This haste hath wings indeed
3217 LAFEU Nay come your ways
3218 This is his Majesty say your mind to him
3219 A traitor you do look like but such traitors
3220 His Majesty seldom fears I am Cressid's uncle
3221 That dare leave two together Fare you well Exit
3222 KING Now fair one does your business follow us
3223 HELENA Ay my good lord
3224 Gerard de Narbon was my father
3225 In what he did profess well found
3226 KING I knew him
3227 HELENA The rather will I spare my praises towards him
3228 Knowing him is enough On's bed of death
3229 Many receipts he gave me chiefly one
3230 Which as the dearest issue of his practice
3231 And of his old experience th only darling
3232 He bade me store up as a triple eye
3233 Safer than mine own two more dear I have so
3234 And hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
3235 With that malignant cause wherein the honour
3236 Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
3237 I come to tender it and my appliance
3238 With all bound humbleness
3239 KING We thank you maiden
3240 But may not be so credulous of cure
3241 When our most learned doctors leave us and
3242 The congregated college have concluded
3243 That labouring art can never ransom nature
3244 From her inaidable estateI say we must not
3245 So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
3246 To prostitute our pastcure malady
3247 To empirics or to dissever so
3248 Our great self and our credit to esteem
3249 A senseless help when help past sense we deem
3250 HELENA My duty then shall pay me for my pains
3251 I will no more enforce mine office on you
3252 Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
3253 A modest one to bear me back again
3254 KING I cannot give thee less to be call'd grateful
3255 Thou thought'st to help me and such thanks I give
3256 As one near death to those that wish him live
3257 But what at full I know thou know'st no part
3258 I knowing all my peril thou no art
3259 HELENA What I can do can do no hurt to try
3260 Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy
3261 He that of greatest works is finisher
3262 Oft does them by the weakest minister
3263 So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
3264 When judges have been babes Great floods have flown
3265 From simple sources and great seas have dried
3266 When miracles have by the greatest been denied
3267 Oft expectation fails and most oft there
3268 Where most it promises and oft it hits
3269 Where hope is coldest and despair most fits
3270 KING I must not hear thee Fare thee well kind maid
3271 Thy pains not us'd must by thyself be paid
3272 Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
3273 HELENA Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd
3274 It is not so with Him that all things knows
3275 As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows
3276 But most it is presumption in us when
3277 The help of heaven we count the act of men
3278 Dear sir to my endeavours give consent
3279 Of heaven not me make an experiment
3280 I am not an impostor that proclaim
3281 Myself against the level of mine aim
3282 But know I think and think I know most sure
3283 My art is not past power nor you past cure
3284 KING Art thou so confident Within what space
3285 Hop'st thou my cure
3286 HELENA The greatest Grace lending grace
3287 Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
3288 Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
3289 Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
3290 Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp
3291 Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
3292 Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
3293 What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
3294 Health shall live free and sickness freely die
3295 KING Upon thy certainty and confidence
3296 What dar'st thou venture
3297 HELENA Tax of impudence
3298 A strumpet's boldness a divulged shame
3299 Traduc'd by odious ballads my maiden's name
3300 Sear'd otherwise ne worse of worstextended
3301 With vilest torture let my life be ended
3302 KING Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
3303 His powerful sound within an organ weak
3304 And what impossibility would slay
3305 In common sense sense saves another way
3306 Thy life is dear for all that life can rate
3307 Worth name of life in thee hath estimate
3308 Youth beauty wisdom courage all
3309 That happiness and prime can happy call
3310 Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
3311 Skill infinite or monstrous desperate
3312 Sweet practiser thy physic I will try
3313 That ministers thine own death if I die
3314 HELENA If I break time or flinch in property
3315 Of what I spoke unpitied let me die
3316 And well deserv'd Not helping death's my fee
3317 But if I help what do you promise me
3318 KING Make thy demand
3319 HELENA But will you make it even
3320 KING Ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
3321 HELENA Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
3322 What husband in thy power I will command
3323 Exempted be from me the arrogance
3324 To choose from forth the royal blood of France
3325 My low and humble name to propagate
3326 With any branch or image of thy state
3327 But such a one thy vassal whom I know
3328 Is free for me to ask thee to bestow
3329 KING Here is my hand the premises observ'd
3330 Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd
3331 So make the choice of thy own time for I
3332 Thy resolv'd patient on thee still rely
3333 More should I question thee and more I must
3334 Though more to know could not be more to trust
3335 From whence thou cam'st how tended on But rest
3336 Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest
3337 Give me some help here ho If thou proceed
3338 As high as word my deed shall match thy deed

3403 LAFEU They say miracles are past and we have our philosophical
3404 persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
3405 causeless Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors
3406 ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
3407 ourselves to an unknown fear
3408 PAROLLES Why 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
3409 out in our latter times
3410 BERTRAM And so 'tis
3411 LAFEU To be relinquish'd of the artists

3428 respect
3429 PAROLLES Nay 'tis strange 'tis very strange that is the brief
3430 and the tedious of it and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
3431 will not acknowledge it to be the
3432 LAFEU Very hand of heaven
3433 PAROLLES Ay so I say
3434 LAFEU In a most weak
3435 PAROLLES And debile minister great power great transcendence

3507 Me and my service ever whilst I live
3508 Into your guiding power This is the man
3509 KING Why then young Bertram take her she's thy wife
3510 BERTRAM My wife my liege I shall beseech your Highness
3511 In such a business give me leave to use
3512 The help of mine own eyes
3513 KING Know'st thou not Bertram
3514 What she has done for me
3515 BERTRAM Yes my good lord
3516 But never hope to know why I should marry her
3517 KING Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed
3518 BERTRAM But follows it my lord to bring me down
3519 Must answer for your raising I know her well
3520 She had her breeding at my father's charge
3521 A poor physician's daughter my wife Disdain
3522 Rather corrupt me ever
3523 KING 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which
3524 I can build up Strange is it that our bloods
3525 Of colour weight and heat pour'd all together
3526 Would quite confound distinction yet stand off
3527 In differences so mighty If she be
3528 All that is virtuoussave what thou dislik'st
3529 A poor physician's daughterthou dislik'st
3530 Of virtue for the name but do not so
3531 From lowest place when virtuous things proceed
3532 The place is dignified by the doer's deed
3533 Where great additions swell's and virtue none
3534 It is a dropsied honour Good alone
3535 Is good without a name Vileness is so
3536 The property by what it is should go
3537 Not by the title She is young wise fair
3538 In these to nature she's immediate heir
3539 And these breed honour That is honour's scorn
3540 Which challenges itself as honour's born
3541 And is not like the sire Honours thrive
3542 When rather from our acts we them derive
3543 Than our foregoers The mere word's a slave
3544 Debauch'd on every tomb on every grave
3545 A lying trophy and as oft is dumb
3546 Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
3547 Of honour'd bones indeed What should be said
3548 If thou canst like this creature as a maid
3549 I can create the rest Virtue and she
3550 Is her own dower honour and wealth from me
3551 BERTRAM I cannot love her nor will strive to do 't
3552 KING Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
3553 HELENA That you are well restor'd my lord I'm glad
3554 Let the rest go
3555 KING My honour's at the stake which to defeat
3556 I must produce my power Here take her hand
3557 Proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
3558 That dost in vile misprision shackle up
3559 My love and her desert that canst not dream
3560 We poising us in her defective scale
3561 Shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
3562 It is in us to plant thine honour where
3563 We please to have it grow Check thy contempt
3564 Obey our will which travails in thy good
3565 Believe not thy disdain but presently
3566 Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
3567 Which both thy duty owes and our power claims
3568 Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
3569 Into the staggers and the careless lapse
3570 Of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
3571 Loosing upon thee in the name of justice
3572 Without all terms of pity Speak thine answer
3573 BERTRAM Pardon my gracious lord for I submit
3574 My fancy to your eyes When I consider
3575 What great creation and what dole of honour
3576 Flies where you bid it I find that she which late
3577 Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
3578 The praised of the King who so ennobled
3579 Is as 'twere born so
3580 KING Take her by the hand
3581 And tell her she is thine to whom I promise
3582 A counterpoise if not to thy estate
3583 A balance more replete
3584 BERTRAM I take her hand
3585 KING Good fortune and the favour of the King
3586 Smile upon this contract whose ceremony
3587 Shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief
3588 And be perform'd tonight The solemn feast
3589 Shall more attend upon the coming space
3590 Expecting absent friends As thou lov'st her
3591 Thy love's to me religious else does err
3592 Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind

3628 o th contrary If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
3629 beaten thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage I
3630 have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee or rather my
3631 knowledge that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know'
3632 PAROLLES My lord you do me most insupportable vexation
3633 LAFEU I would it were hell pains for thy sake and my poor doing
3634 eternal for doing I am past as I will by thee in what motion

4162 HELENA O I believe with him
4163 In argument of praise or to the worth
4164 Of the great Count himself she is too mean
4165 To have her name repeated all her deserving
4166 Is a reserved honesty and that
4167 I have not heard examin'd
4168 DIANA Alas poor lady
4169 'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
4170 Of a detesting lord
4171 WIDOW I sweet good creature wheresoe'er she is

4218 Camp before Florence
4219 Enter BERTRAM and the two FRENCH LORDS
4220 SECOND LORD Nay good my lord put him to't let him have his way
4221 FIRST LORD If your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more
4222 in your respect
4223 SECOND LORD On my life my lord a bubble
4224 BERTRAM Do you think I am so far deceived in him
4225 SECOND LORD Believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
4226 without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he's a
4227 most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly
4228 promisebreaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your
4229 lordship's entertainment
4230 FIRST LORD It were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his
4231 virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty
4232 business in a main danger fail you
4233 BERTRAM I would I knew in what particular action to try him
4234 FIRST LORD None better than to let him fetch off his drum which
4235 you hear him so confidently undertake to do
4236 SECOND LORD I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise
4237 him such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy
4238 We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
4239 but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
4240 we bring him to our own tents Be but your lordship present at
4241 his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in
4242 the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and
4243 deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that
4244 with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my
4245 judgment in anything
4246 FIRST LORD O for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he
4247 says he has a stratagem for't When your lordship sees the bottom
4248 of his success in't and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
4249 ore will be melted if you give him not John Drum's
4250 entertainment your inclining cannot be removed Here he comes
4251 Enter PAROLLES
4252 SECOND LORD O for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of
4253 his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand
4254 BERTRAM How now monsieur This drum sticks sorely in your
4255 disposition
4256 FIRST LORD A pox on 't let it go 'tis but a drum
4257 PAROLLES But a drum Is't but a drum A drum so lost There was
4258 excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own
4259 wings and to rend our own soldiers
4260 FIRST LORD That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
4261 service it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
4262 have prevented if he had been there to command
4263 BERTRAM Well we cannot greatly condemn our success
4264 Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to
4265 be recovered
4266 PAROLLES It might have been recovered
4267 BERTRAM It might but it is not now
4268 PAROLLES It is to be recovered But that the merit of service is
4269 seldom attributed to the true and exact performer I would have
4270 that drum or another or 'hic jacet'
4271 BERTRAM Why if you have a stomach to't monsieur If you think
4272 your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
4273 again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise
4274 and go on I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit If you
4275 speed well in it the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
4276 you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost
4277 syllable of our worthiness
4278 PAROLLES By the hand of a soldier I will undertake it
4279 BERTRAM But you must not now slumber in it
4280 PAROLLES I'll about it this evening and I will presently pen
4281 down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself
4282 into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further
4283 from me
4284 BERTRAM May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it
4285 PAROLLES I know not what the success will be my lord but the
4286 attempt I vow
4287 BERTRAM I know th art valiant and to the of thy soldiership
4288 will subscribe for thee Farewell
4289 PAROLLES I love not many words Exit
4290 SECOND LORD No more than a fish loves water Is not this a strange
4291 fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this
4292 business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do
4293 and dares better be damn'd than to do 't
4294 FIRST LORD You do not know him my lord as we do Certain it is
4295 that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week
4296 escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out
4297 you have him ever after
4298 BERTRAM Why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
4299 so seriously he does address himself unto
4300 SECOND LORD None in the world but return with an invention and
4301 clap upon you two or three probable lies But we have almost
4302 emboss'd him You shall see his fall tonight for indeed he is
4303 not for your lordship's respect
4304 FIRST LORD We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him
4305 He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu When his disguise and
4306 he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you
4307 shall see this very night
4308 SECOND LORD I must go look my twigs he shall be caught
4309 BERTRAM Your brother he shall go along with me
4310 SECOND LORD As't please your lordship I'll leave you Exit
4311 BERTRAM Now will I lead you to the house and show you
4312 The lass I spoke of
4313 FIRST LORD But you say she's honest
4314 BERTRAM That's all the fault I spoke with her but once
4315 And found her wondrous cold but I sent to her
4316 By this same coxcomb that we have i th wind
4317 Tokens and letters which she did resend
4318 And this is all I have done She's a fair creature
4319 Will you go see her
4320 FIRST LORD With all my heart my lord Exeunt

4323 Enter HELENA and WIDOW
4324 HELENA If you misdoubt me that I am not she
4325 I know not how I shall assure you further
4326 But I shall lose the grounds I work upon
4327 WIDOW Though my estate be fall'n I was well born
4328 Nothing acquainted with these businesses
4329 And would not put my reputation now
4330 In any staining act
4331 HELENA Nor would I wish you
4332 FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband
4333 And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
4334 Is so from word to word and then you cannot
4335 By the good aid that I of you shall borrow
4336 Err in bestowing it
4337 WIDOW I should believe you
4338 For you have show'd me that which well approves
4339 Y'are great in fortune
4340 HELENA Take this purse of gold
4341 And let me buy your friendly help thus far
4342 Which I will overpay and pay again
4343 When I have found it The Count he woos your daughter
4344 Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
4345 Resolv'd to carry her Let her in fine consent
4346 As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it
4347 Now his important blood will nought deny
4348 That she'll demand A ring the County wears
4349 That downward hath succeeded in his house
4350 From son to son some four or five descents
4351 Since the first father wore it This ring he holds
4352 In most rich choice yet in his idle fire
4353 To buy his will it would not seem too dear
4354 Howe'er repented after
4355 WIDOW Now I see
4356 The bottom of your purpose
4357 HELENA You see it lawful then It is no more
4358 But that your daughter ere she seems as won
4359 Desires this ring appoints him an encounter
4360 In fine delivers me to fill the time
4361 Herself most chastely absent After this
4362 To marry her I'll add three thousand crowns
4363 To what is pass'd already
4364 WIDOW I have yielded
4365 Instruct my daughter how she shall persever
4366 That time and place with this deceit so lawful
4367 May prove coherent Every night he comes
4368 With musics of all sorts and songs compos'd
4369 To her unworthiness It nothing steads us
4370 To chide him from our eaves for he persists
4371 As if his life lay on 't
4372 HELENA Why then tonight
4373 Let us assay our plot which if it speed
4374 Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
4375 And lawful meaning in a lawful act
4376 Where both not sin and yet a sinful fact
4377 But let's about it Exeunt

4397 SECOND LORD But what linseywoolsey has thou to speak to us again
4398 FIRST SOLDIER E'en such as you speak to me
4399 SECOND LORD He must think us some band of strangers i th'
4400 adversary's entertainment Now he hath a smack of all
4401 neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of
4402 his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we
4403 seem to know is to know straight our purpose choughs language
4404 gabble enough and good enough As for you interpreter you must
4405 seem very politic But couch ho here he comes to beguile two
4406 hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges

4410 very plausive invention that carries it They begin to smoke me
4411 and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door I find my
4412 tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of Mars
4413 before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my
4414 tongue
4415 SECOND LORD This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
4416 guilty of
4417 PAROLLES What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
4418 of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and
4419 knowing I had no such purpose I must give myself some hurts and
4420 say I got them in exploit Yet slight ones will not carry it
4421 They will say 'Came you off with so little And great ones I
4422 dare not give Wherefore what's the instance Tongue I must put
4423 you into a butterwoman's mouth and buy myself another of
4424 Bajazet's mule if you prattle me into these perils
4425 SECOND LORD Is it possible he should know what he is and be that
4426 he is
4427 PAROLLES I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn
4428 or the breaking of my Spanish sword
4429 SECOND LORD We cannot afford you so
4430 PAROLLES Or the baring of my beard and to say it was in
4431 stratagem
4432 SECOND LORD 'Twould not do
4433 PAROLLES Or to drown my clothes and say I was stripp'd
4434 SECOND LORD Hardly serve

4483 Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
4484 BERTRAM They told me that your name was Fontibell
4485 DIANA No my good lord Diana
4486 BERTRAM Titled goddess
4487 And worth it with addition But fair soul
4488 In your fine frame hath love no quality
4489 If the quick fire of youth light not your mind
4490 You are no maiden but a monument
4491 When you are dead you should be such a one
4492 As you are now for you are cold and stern
4493 And now you should be as your mother was
4494 When your sweet self was got
4495 DIANA She then was honest
4496 BERTRAM So should you be
4497 DIANA No
4498 My mother did but duty such my lord
4499 As you owe to your wife
4500 BERTRAM No more o'that
4501 I prithee do not strive against my vows
4502 I was compell'd to her but I love the
4503 By love's own sweet constraint and will for ever
4504 Do thee all rights of service
4505 DIANA Ay so you serve us
4506 Till we serve you but when you have our roses
4507 You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
4508 And mock us with our bareness
4509 BERTRAM How have I sworn
4510 DIANA 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
4511 But the plain single vow that is vow'd true
4512 What is not holy that we swear not by
4513 But take the High'st to witness Then pray you tell me
4514 If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
4515 I lov'd you dearly would you believe my oaths
4516 When I did love you ill This has no holding
4517 To swear by him whom I protest to love
4518 That I will work against him Therefore your oaths
4519 Are words and poor conditions but unseal'd
4520 At least in my opinion
4521 BERTRAM Change it change it
4522 Be not so holycruel Love is holy
4523 And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
4524 That you do charge men with Stand no more off
4525 But give thyself unto my sick desires
4526 Who then recovers Say thou art mine and ever
4527 My love as it begins shall so persever
4528 DIANA I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
4529 That we'll forsake ourselves Give me that ring
4530 BERTRAM I'll lend it thee my dear but have no power
4531 To give it from me
4532 DIANA Will you not my lord
4533 BERTRAM It is an honour 'longing to our house
4534 Bequeathed down from many ancestors
4535 Which were the greatest obloquy i th world
4536 In me to lose
4537 DIANA Mine honour's such a ring
4538 My chastity's the jewel of our house
4539 Bequeathed down from many ancestors
4540 Which were the greatest obloquy i th world
4541 In me to lose Thus your own proper wisdom
4542 Brings in the champion Honour on my part
4543 Against your vain assault
4544 BERTRAM Here take my ring
4545 My house mine honour yea my life be thine
4546 And I'll be bid by thee
4547 DIANA When midnight comes knock at my chamber window
4548 I'll order take my mother shall not hear
4549 Now will I charge you in the band of truth
4550 When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed
4551 Remain there but an hour nor speak to me
4552 My reasons are most strong and you shall know them
4553 When back again this ring shall be deliver'd
4554 And on your finger in the night I'll put
4555 Another ring that what in time proceeds
4556 May token to the future our past deeds
4557 Adieu till then then fail not You have won
4558 A wife of me though there my hope be done
4559 BERTRAM A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee
4560 Exit
4561 DIANA For which live long to thank both heaven and me
4562 You may so in the end
4563 My mother told me just how he would woo
4564 As if she sat in's heart she says all men
4565 Have the like oaths He had sworn to marry me
4566 When his wife's dead therefore I'll lie with him
4567 When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid
4568 Marry that will I live and die a maid
4569 Only in this disguise I think't no sin
4570 To cozen him that would unjustly win Exit
4571 ACT IV SCENE 3
4572 The Florentine camp
4573 Enter the two FRENCH LORDS and two or three SOLDIERS
4574 SECOND LORD You have not given him his mother's letter
4575 FIRST LORD I have deliv'red it an hour since There is something
4576 in't that stings his nature for on the reading it he chang'd
4577 almost into another man
4578 SECOND LORD He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
4579 so good a wife and so sweet a lady
4580 FIRST LORD Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
4581 of the King who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to
4582 him I will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly
4583 with you
4584 SECOND LORD When you have spoken it 'tis dead and I am the grave
4585 of it
4586 FIRST LORD He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence
4587 of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in
4588 the spoil of her honour He hath given her his monumental ring
4589 and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition
4590 SECOND LORD Now God delay our rebellion As we are ourselves
4591 what things are we
4592 FIRST LORD Merely our own traitors And as in the common course of
4593 all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
4594 to their abhorr'd ends so he that in this action contrives
4595 against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows
4596 himself
4597 SECOND LORD Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
4598 unlawful intents We shall not then have his company tonight
4599 FIRST LORD Not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
4600 SECOND LORD That approaches apace I would gladly have him see his
4601 company anatomiz'd that he might take a measure of his own
4602 judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit
4603 FIRST LORD We will not meddle with him till he come for his
4604 presence must be the whip of the other
4605 SECOND LORD In the meantime what hear you of these wars
4606 FIRST LORD I hear there is an overture of peace
4607 SECOND LORD Nay I assure you a peace concluded
4608 FIRST LORD What will Count Rousillon do then Will he travel
4609 higher or return again into France
4610 SECOND LORD I perceive by this demand you are not altogether
4611 of his counsel
4612 FIRST LORD Let it be forbid sir So should I be a great deal
4613 of his act
4614 SECOND LORD Sir his wife some two months since fled from his
4615 house Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand
4616 which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
4617 accomplish'd and there residing the tenderness of her nature
4618 became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last
4619 breath and now she sings in heaven
4620 FIRST LORD How is this justified
4621 SECOND LORD The stronger part of it by her own letters which
4622 makes her story true even to the point of her death Her death
4623 itself which could not be her office to say is come was
4624 faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place
4625 FIRST LORD Hath the Count all this intelligence
4626 SECOND LORD Ay and the particular confirmations point from
4627 point to the full arming of the verity
4628 FIRST LORD I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this
4629 SECOND LORD How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
4630 losses
4631 FIRST LORD And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
4632 tears The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
4633 him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample
4634 SECOND LORD The web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill
4635 together Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
4636 not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by
4637 our virtues

4763 boy but for all that very ruttish I pray you sir put it up
4764 again
4765 FIRST SOLDIER Nay I'll read it first by your favour
4766 PAROLLES My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the behalf
4767 of the maid for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
4768 lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all
4769 the fry it finds
4770 BERTRAM Damnable bothsides rogue
4771 FIRST SOLDIER [Reads]
4772 'When he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it

4792 remainder of nature Let me live sir in a dungeon i th'
4793 stocks or anywhere so I may live
4794 FIRST SOLDIER We'll see what may be done so you confess freely
4795 therefore once more to this Captain Dumain you have answer'd to
4796 his reputation with the Duke and to his valour what is his
4797 honesty
4798 PAROLLES He will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes
4799 and ravishments he parallels Nessus He professes not keeping of
4800 oaths in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules He will lie
4801 sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool
4802 Drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swinedrunk and
4803 in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about
4804 him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw I have
4805 but little more to say sir of his honesty He has everything
4806 that an honest man should not have what an honest man should
4807 have he has nothing
4808 SECOND LORD I begin to love him for this
4809 BERTRAM For this description of thine honesty A pox upon him For
4810 me he's more and more a cat

4813 tragediansto belie him I will notand more of his soldiership

4815 officer at a place there called Mileend to instruct for the
4816 doubling of filesI would do the man what honour I canbut of
4817 this I am not certain
4818 SECOND LORD He hath outvillain'd villainy so far that the rarity
4819 redeems him
4820 BERTRAM A pox on him he's a cat still
4821 FIRST SOLDIER His qualities being at this poor price I need not
4822 to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
4823 PAROLLES Sir for a cardecue he will sell the feesimple of his
4824 salvation the inheritance of it and cut th entail from all
4825 remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually
4826 FIRST SOLDIER What's his brother the other Captain Dumain
4827 FIRST LORD Why does he ask him of me
4828 FIRST SOLDIER What's he
4829 PAROLLES E'en a crow o th same nest not altogether so great as
4830 the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil He
4831 excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one
4832 of the best that is In a retreat he outruns any lackey marry
4833 in coming on he has the cramp
4834 FIRST SOLDIER If your life be saved will you undertake to betray
4835 the Florentine
4836 PAROLLES Ay and the Captain of his Horse Count Rousillon
4837 FIRST SOLDIER I'll whisper with the General and know his
4838 pleasure
4839 PAROLLES [Aside] I'll no more drumming A plague of all drums
4840 Only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of
4841 that lascivious young boy the Count have I run into this danger
4842 Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken
4843 FIRST SOLDIER There is no remedy sir but you must die
4844 The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the
4845 secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men
4846 very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore
4847 you must die Come headsman of with his head
4848 PAROLLES O Lord sir let me live or let me see my death

4850 friends [Unmuffling him] So look about you know you any here

5121 Flourish Enter KING COUNTESS LAFEU the two FRENCH LORDS with ATTENDANTS
5122 KING We lost a jewel of her and our esteem
5123 Was made much poorer by it but your son
5124 As mad in folly lack'd the sense to know
5125 Her estimation home
5126 COUNTESS 'Tis past my liege
5127 And I beseech your Majesty to make it
5128 Natural rebellion done i th blaze of youth
5129 When oil and fire too strong for reason's force
5130 O'erbears it and burns on
5131 KING My honour'd lady
5132 I have forgiven and forgotten all
5133 Though my revenges were high bent upon him
5134 And watch'd the time to shoot
5135 LAFEU This I must say
5136 But first I beg my pardon the young lord
5137 Did to his Majesty his mother and his lady
5138 Offence of mighty note but to himself
5139 The greatest wrong of all He lost a wife
5140 Whose beauty did astonish the survey
5141 Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
5142 Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
5143 Humbly call'd mistress
5144 KING Praising what is lost
5145 Makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither
5146 We are reconcil'd and the first view shall kill
5147 All repetition Let him not ask our pardon
5148 The nature of his great offence is dead
5149 And deeper than oblivion do we bury
5150 Th incensing relics of it let him approach
5151 A stranger no offender and inform him
5152 So 'tis our will he should
5153 GENTLEMAN I shall my liege Exit GENTLEMAN
5154 KING What says he to your daughter Have you spoke
5155 LAFEU All that he is hath reference to your Highness
5156 KING Then shall we have a match I have letters sent me
5157 That sets him high in fame
5158 Enter BERTRAM
5159 LAFEU He looks well on 't
5160 KING I am not a day of season
5161 For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
5162 In me at once But to the brightest beams
5163 Distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
5164 The time is fair again
5165 BERTRAM My highrepented blames
5166 Dear sovereign pardon to me
5167 KING All is whole
5168 Not one word more of the consumed time
5169 Let's take the instant by the forward top
5170 For we are old and on our quick'st decrees
5171 Th inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
5172 Steals ere we can effect them You remember
5173 The daughter of this lord
5174 BERTRAM Admiringly my liege At first
5175 I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
5176 Durst make too bold herald of my tongue
5177 Where the impression of mine eye infixing
5178 Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
5179 Which warp'd the line of every other favour
5180 Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n
5181 Extended or contracted all proportions
5182 To a most hideous object Thence it came
5183 That she whom all men prais'd and whom myself
5184 Since I have lost have lov'd was in mine eye
5185 The dust that did offend it
5186 KING Well excus'd
5187 That thou didst love her strikes some scores away
5188 From the great compt but love that comes too late
5189 Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
5190 To the great sender turns a sour offence
5191 Crying 'That's good that's gone Our rash faults
5192 Make trivial price of serious things we have
5193 Not knowing them until we know their grave
5194 Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
5195 Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
5196 Our own love waking cries to see what's done
5197 While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon
5198 Be this sweet Helen's knell And now forget her
5199 Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin
5200 The main consents are had and here we'll stay
5201 To see our widower's second marriageday
5202 COUNTESS Which better than the first O dear heaven bless
5203 Or ere they meet in me O nature cesse
5204 LAFEU Come on my son in whom my house's name
5205 Must be digested give a favour from you
5206 To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
5207 That she may quickly come
5208 [BERTRAM gives a ring]
5209 By my old beard
5210 And ev'ry hair that's on 't Helen that's dead
5211 Was a sweet creature such a ring as this
5212 The last that e'er I took her leave at court
5213 I saw upon her finger
5214 BERTRAM Hers it was not
5215 KING Now pray you let me see it for mine eye
5216 While I was speaking oft was fasten'd to't
5217 This ring was mine and when I gave it Helen
5218 I bade her if her fortunes ever stood
5219 Necessitied to help that by this token
5220 I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave her
5221 Of what should stead her most
5222 BERTRAM My gracious sovereign
5223 Howe'er it pleases you to take it so
5224 The ring was never hers
5225 COUNTESS Son on my life
5226 I have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it
5227 At her life's rate
5228 LAFEU I am sure I saw her wear it
5229 BERTRAM You are deceiv'd my lord she never saw it
5230 In Florence was it from a casement thrown me
5231 Wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name
5232 Of her that threw it Noble she was and thought
5233 I stood engag'd but when I had subscrib'd
5234 To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
5235 I could not answer in that course of honour
5236 As she had made the overture she ceas'd
5237 In heavy satisfaction and would never
5238 Receive the ring again
5239 KING Plutus himself
5240 That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine
5241 Hath not in nature's mystery more science
5242 Than I have in this ring 'Twas mine 'twas Helen's
5243 Whoever gave it you Then if you know
5244 That you are well acquainted with yourself
5245 Confess 'twas hers and by what rough enforcement
5246 You got it from her She call'd the saints to surety
5247 That she would never put it from her finger
5248 Unless she gave it to yourself in bed
5249 Where you have never come or sent it us
5250 Upon her great disaster
5251 BERTRAM She never saw it
5252 KING Thou speak'st it falsely as I love mine honour
5253 And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
5254 Which I would fain shut out If it should prove
5255 That thou art so inhuman 'twill not prove so
5256 And yet I know not thou didst hate her deadly
5257 And she is dead which nothing but to close
5258 Her eyes myself could win me to believe
5259 More than to see this ring Take him away
5260 [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]
5261 My forepast proofs howe'er the matter fall
5262 Shall tax my fears of little vanity
5263 Having vainly fear'd too little Away with him
5264 We'll sift this matter further
5265 BERTRAM If you shall prove
5266 This ring was ever hers you shall as easy
5267 Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence
5268 Where she yet never was Exit guarded
5269 KING I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings
5270 Enter a GENTLEMAN
5271 GENTLEMAN Gracious sovereign
5272 Whether I have been to blame or no I know not
5273 Here's a petition from a Florentine
5274 Who hath for four or five removes come short
5275 To tender it herself I undertook it
5276 Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
5277 Of the poor suppliant who by this I know
5278 Is here attending her business looks in her
5279 With an importing visage and she told me
5280 In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
5281 Your Highness with herself
5282 KING [Reads the letter] 'Upon his many protestations to marry me
5283 when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won me Now is the
5284 Count Rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my
5285 honour's paid to him He stole from Florence taking no leave
5286 and I follow him to his country for justice Grant it me O King

5326 BERTRAM My lord this is a fond and desp'rate creature
5327 Whom sometime I have laugh'd with Let your Highness
5328 Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
5329 Than for to think that I would sink it here
5330 KING Sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
5331 Till your deeds gain them Fairer prove your honour
5332 Than in my thought it lies
5333 DIANA Good my lord

5339 DIANA He does me wrong my lord if I were so
5340 He might have bought me at a common price
5341 Do not believe him o behold this ring

5362 That will speak anything
5363 KING She hath that ring of yours
5364 BERTRAM I think she has Certain it is I lik'd her
5365 And boarded her i th wanton way of youth
5366 She knew her distance and did angle for me
5367 Madding my eagerness with her restraint
5368 As all impediments in fancy's course
5369 Are motives of more fancy and in fine
5370 Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
5371 Subdu'd me to her rate She got the ring
5372 And I had that which any inferior might
5373 At marketprice have bought

5450 I'll swear I am a maid and he knows not
5451 Great King I am no strumpet by my life

5569 PHILO Nay but this dotage of our general's
5570 O'erflows the measure Those his goodly eyes
5571 That o'er the files and musters of the war
5572 Have glow'd like plated Mars now bend now turn
5573 The office and devotion of their view
5574 Upon a tawny front His captain's heart
5575 Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
5576 The buckles on his breast reneges all temper
5577 And is become the bellows and the fan
5578 To cool a gipsy's lust
5579 Flourish Enter ANTONY CLEOPATRA her LADIES the train
5580 with eunuchs fanning her

5583 The triple pillar of the world transform'd
5584 Into a strumpet's fool Behold and see
5585 CLEOPATRA If it be love indeed tell me how much
5586 ANTONY There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd
5587 CLEOPATRA I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd
5588 ANTONY Then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth
5589 Enter a MESSENGER

5597 Perform't or else we damn thee'
5598 ANTONY How my love

5600 You must not stay here longer your dismission
5601 Is come from Caesar therefore hear it Antony
5602 Where's Fulvia's process Caesar's I would say Both
5603 Call in the messengers As I am Egypt's Queen
5604 Thou blushest Antony and that blood of thine
5605 Is Caesar's homager Else so thy cheek pays shame
5606 When shrilltongu'd Fulvia scolds The messengers
5607 ANTONY Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch
5608 Of the rang'd empire fall Here is my space

5613 On pain of punishment the world to weet
5614 We stand up peerless

5616 Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her
5617 I'll seem the fool I am not Antony
5618 Will be himself
5619 ANTONY But stirr'd by Cleopatra
5620 Now for the love of Love and her soft hours
5621 Let's not confound the time with conference harsh
5622 There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
5623 Without some pleasure now What sport tonight
5624 CLEOPATRA Hear the ambassadors
5625 ANTONY Fie wrangling queen
5626 Whom everything becomes to chide to laugh
5627 To weep whose every passion fully strives
5628 To make itself in thee fair and admir'd

5630 Tonight we'll wander through the streets and note

5634 DEMETRIUS Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight
5635 PHILO Sir sometimes when he is not Antony
5636 He comes too short of that great property
5637 Which still should go with Antony
5638 DEMETRIUS I am full sorry
5639 That he approves the common liar who
5640 Thus speaks of him at Rome but I will hope
5641 Of better deeds tomorrow Rest you happy Exeunt

5749 MESSENGER O my lord
5750 ANTONY Speak to me home mince not the general tongue
5751 Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome
5752 Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase and taunt my faults
5753 With such full licence as both truth and malice
5754 Have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds

5772 There's a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it
5773 What our contempts doth often hurl from us
5774 We wish it ours again the present pleasure
5775 By revolution low'ring does become
5776 The opposite of itself She's good being gone
5777 The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on

5784 ENOBARBUS Why then we kill all our women We see how mortal an
5785 unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure death's the
5786 word
5787 ANTONY I must be gone
5788 ENOBARBUS Under a compelling occasion let women die It were pity
5789 to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great
5790 cause they should be esteemed nothing Cleopatra catching but
5791 the least noise of this dies instantly I have seen her die
5792 twenty times upon far poorer moment I do think there is mettle
5793 in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a
5794 celerity in dying
5795 ANTONY She is cunning past man's thought
5796 ENOBARBUS Alack sir no Her passions are made of nothing but the
5797 finest part of pure love We cannot call her winds and waters
5798 sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than
5799 almanacs can report This cannot be cunning in her if it be she
5800 makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove
5801 ANTONY Would I had never seen her
5802 ENOBARBUS O Sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
5803 work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
5804 your travel
5805 ANTONY Fulvia is dead
5806 ENOBARBUS Sir
5807 ANTONY Fulvia is dead
5808 ENOBARBUS Fulvia
5809 ANTONY Dead
5810 ENOBARBUS Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice When it
5811 pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it
5812 shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that
5813 when old robes are worn out there are members to make new If
5814 there were no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut
5815 and the case to be lamented This grief is crown'd with
5816 consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and
5817 indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
5818 ANTONY The business she hath broached in the state
5819 Cannot endure my absence
5820 ENOBARBUS And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
5821 without you especially that of Cleopatra's which wholly depends
5822 on your abode
5823 ANTONY No more light answers Let our officers
5824 Have notice what we purpose I shall break
5825 The cause of our expedience to the Queen
5826 And get her leave to part For not alone
5827 The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches
5828 Do strongly speak to us but the letters to
5829 Of many our contriving friends in Rome
5830 Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius
5831 Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands
5832 The empire of the sea our slippery people
5833 Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
5834 Till his deserts are past begin to throw
5835 Pompey the Great and all his dignities
5836 Upon his son who high in name and power
5837 Higher than both in blood and life stands up
5838 For the main soldier whose quality going on
5839 The sides o th world may danger Much is breeding
5840 Which like the courser's hair hath yet but life
5841 And not a serpent's poison Say our pleasure
5842 To such whose place is under us requires

5855 You do not hold the method to enforce
5856 The like from him
5857 CLEOPATRA What should I do I do not
5858 CHARMIAN In each thing give him way cross him in nothing
5859 CLEOPATRA Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him

5866 CLEOPATRA Help me away dear Charmian I shall fall
5867 It cannot be thus long the sides of nature
5868 Will not sustain it
5869 ANTONY Now my dearest queen
5870 CLEOPATRA Pray you stand farther from me
5871 ANTONY What's the matter
5872 CLEOPATRA I know by that same eye there's some good news
5873 What says the married woman You may go

5875 Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here
5876 I have no power upon you hers you are
5877 ANTONY The gods best know
5878 CLEOPATRA O never was there queen
5879 So mightily betray'd Yet at the first
5880 I saw the treasons planted
5881 ANTONY Cleopatra
5882 CLEOPATRA Why should I think you can be mine and true
5883 Though you in swearing shake the throned gods
5884 Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness
5885 To be entangled with those mouthmade vows
5886 Which break themselves in swearing
5887 ANTONY Most sweet queen
5888 CLEOPATRA Nay pray you seek no colour for your going
5889 But bid farewell and go When you sued staying
5890 Then was the time for words No going then
5891 Eternity was in our lips and eyes
5892 Bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor
5893 But was a race of heaven They are so still
5894 Or thou the greatest soldier of the world
5895 Art turn'd the greatest liar
5896 ANTONY How now lady
5897 CLEOPATRA I would I had thy inches Thou shouldst know
5898 There were a heart in Egypt
5899 ANTONY Hear me queen
5900 The strong necessity of time commands
5901 Our services awhile but my full heart
5902 Remains in use with you Our Italy
5903 Shines o'er with civil swords Sextus Pompeius
5904 Makes his approaches to the port of Rome
5905 Equality of two domestic powers
5906 Breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
5907 Are newly grown to love The condemn'd Pompey
5908 Rich in his father's honour creeps apace
5909 Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
5910 Upon the present state whose numbers threaten
5911 And quietness grown sick of rest would purge
5912 By any desperate change My more particular
5913 And that which most with you should safe my going
5914 Is Fulvia's death
5915 CLEOPATRA Though age from folly could not give me freedom
5916 It does from childishness Can Fulvia die
5917 ANTONY She's dead my Queen
5918 Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
5919 The garboils she awak'd At the last best
5920 See when and where she died
5921 CLEOPATRA O most false love
5922 Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
5923 With sorrowful water Now I see I see
5924 In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be
5925 ANTONY Quarrel no more but be prepar'd to know
5926 The purposes I bear which are or cease
5927 As you shall give th advice By the fire
5928 That quickens Nilus slime I go from hence
5929 Thy soldier servant making peace or war
5930 As thou affects
5931 CLEOPATRA Cut my lace Charmian come
5932 But let it be I am quickly ill and well
5933 So Antony loves
5934 ANTONY My precious queen forbear
5935 And give true evidence to his love which stands
5936 An honourable trial
5937 CLEOPATRA So Fulvia told me
5938 I prithee turn aside and weep for her
5939 Then bid adieu to me and say the tears
5940 Belong to Egypt Good now play one scene
5941 Of excellent dissembling and let it look
5942 Like perfect honour
5943 ANTONY You'll heat my blood no more
5944 CLEOPATRA You can do better yet but this is meetly
5945 ANTONY Now by my sword
5946 CLEOPATRA And target Still he mends
5947 But this is not the best Look prithee Charmian
5948 How this Herculean Roman does become
5949 The carriage of his chafe
5950 ANTONY I'll leave you lady
5951 CLEOPATRA Courteous lord one word
5952 Sir you and I must part but that's not it
5953 Sir you and I have lov'd but there's not it
5954 That you know well Something it is I would
5955 O my oblivion is a very Antony
5956 And I am all forgotten
5957 ANTONY But that your royalty
5958 Holds idleness your subject I should take you
5959 For idleness itself
5960 CLEOPATRA 'Tis sweating labour
5961 To bear such idleness so near the heart
5962 As Cleopatra this But sir forgive me
5963 Since my becomings kill me when they do not
5964 Eye well to you Your honour calls you hence
5965 Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
5966 And all the gods go with you Upon your sword
5967 Sit laurel victory and smooth success
5968 Be strew'd before your feet
5969 ANTONY Let us go Come
5970 Our separation so abides and flies
5971 That thou residing here goes yet with me
5972 And I hence fleeting here remain with thee
5973 Away Exeunt

5975 Rome CAESAR'S house
5976 Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter LEPIDUS and their train
5977 CAESAR You may see Lepidus and henceforth know
5978 It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
5979 Our great competitor From Alexandria
5980 This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
5981 The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
5982 Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy
5983 More womanly than he hardly gave audience or
5984 Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners You shall find there
5985 A man who is the abstract of all faults
5986 That all men follow
5987 LEPIDUS I must not think there are
5988 Evils enow to darken all his goodness
5989 His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
5990 More fiery by night's blackness hereditary
5991 Rather than purchas'd what he cannot change
5992 Than what he chooses
5993 CAESAR You are too indulgent Let's grant it is not
5994 Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy
5995 To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
5996 And keep the turn of tippling with a slave
5997 To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
5998 With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him
5999 As his composure must be rare indeed
6000 Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony
6001 No way excuse his foils when we do bear
6002 So great weight in his lightness If he fill'd
6003 His vacancy with his voluptuousness
6004 Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
6005 Call on him for't But to confound such time
6006 That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
6007 As his own state and ours 'tis to be chid
6008 As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
6009 Pawn their experience to their present pleasure
6010 And so rebel to judgment
6011 Enter a MESSENGER
6012 LEPIDUS Here's more news
6013 MESSENGER Thy biddings have been done and every hour
6014 Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report
6015 How 'tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea
6016 And it appears he is belov'd of those
6017 That only have fear'd Caesar To the ports
6018 The discontents repair and men's reports
6019 Give him much wrong'd
6020 CAESAR I should have known no less
6021 It hath been taught us from the primal state
6022 That he which is was wish'd until he were
6023 And the ebb'd man ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love
6024 Comes dear'd by being lack'd This common body
6025 Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
6026 Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
6027 To rot itself with motion
6028 MESSENGER Caesar I bring thee word
6029 Menecrates and Menas famous pirates
6030 Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
6031 With keels of every kind Many hot inroads
6032 They make in Italy the borders maritime
6033 Lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt
6034 No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
6035 Taken as seen for Pompey's name strikes more
6036 Than could his war resisted
6037 CAESAR Antony
6038 Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once
6039 Was beaten from Modena where thou slew'st
6040 Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel
6041 Did famine follow whom thou fought'st against
6042 Though daintily brought up with patience more
6043 Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink
6044 The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
6045 Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign
6046 The roughest berry on the rudest hedge
6047 Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
6048 The barks of trees thou brows'd On the Alps
6049 It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
6050 Which some did die to look on And all this
6051 It wounds thine honour that I speak it now
6052 Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
6053 So much as lank'd not
6054 LEPIDUS 'Tis pity of him
6055 CAESAR Let his shames quickly
6056 Drive him to Rome 'Tis time we twain
6057 Did show ourselves i th field and to that end
6058 Assemble we immediate council Pompey
6059 Thrives in our idleness
6060 LEPIDUS Tomorrow Caesar
6061 I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
6062 Both what by sea and land I can be able
6063 To front this present time
6064 CAESAR Till which encounter
6065 It is my business too Farewell
6066 LEPIDUS Farewell my lord What you shall know meantime
6067 Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir
6068 To let me be partaker
6069 CAESAR Doubt not sir
6070 I knew it for my bond Exeunt

6084 CLEOPATRA Thou eunuch Mardian
6085 MARDIAN What's your Highness pleasure

6088 That being unseminar'd thy freer thoughts
6089 May not fly forth of Egypt Hast thou affections
6090 MARDIAN Yes gracious madam
6091 CLEOPATRA Indeed
6092 MARDIAN Not in deed madam for I can do nothing
6093 But what indeed is honest to be done
6094 Yet have I fierce affections and think
6095 What Venus did with Mars
6096 CLEOPATRA O Charmian
6097 Where think'st thou he is now Stands he or sits he
6098 Or does he walk or is he on his horse
6099 O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony
6100 Do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st
6101 The demiAtlas of this earth the arm
6102 And burgonet of men He's speaking now
6103 Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile'

6105 With most delicious poison Think on me
6106 That am with Phoebus amorous pinches black
6107 And wrinkled deep in time Broadfronted Caesar
6108 When thou wast here above the ground I was
6109 A morsel for a monarch and great Pompey

6122 CLEOPATRA Mine ear must pluck it thence
6123 ALEXAS 'Good friend quoth he
6124 'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
6125 This treasure of an oyster at whose foot
6126 To mend the petty present I will piece
6127 Her opulent throne with kingdoms All the East
6128 Say thou shall call her mistress So he nodded
6129 And soberly did mount an armgaunt steed
6130 Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
6131 Was beastly dumb'd by him
6132 CLEOPATRA What was he sad or merry
6133 ALEXAS Like to the time o th year between the extremes
6134 Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
6135 CLEOPATRA O welldivided disposition Note him
6136 Note him good Charmian 'tis the man but note him
6137 He was not sad for he would shine on those
6138 That make their looks by his he was not merry
6139 Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
6140 In Egypt with his joy but between both
6141 O heavenly mingle Be'st thou sad or merry
6142 The violence of either thee becomes
6143 So does it no man else Met'st thou my posts
6144 ALEXAS Ay madam twenty several messengers
6145 Why do you send so thick
6146 CLEOPATRA Who's born that day
6147 When I forget to send to Antony
6148 Shall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmian
6149 Welcome my good Alexas Did I Charmian
6150 Ever love Caesar so
6151 CHARMIAN O that brave Caesar
6152 CLEOPATRA Be chok'd with such another emphasis
6153 Say 'the brave Antony'
6154 CHARMIAN The valiant Caesar
6155 CLEOPATRA By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth
6156 If thou with Caesar paragon again
6157 My man of men
6158 CHARMIAN By your most gracious pardon
6159 I sing but after you
6160 CLEOPATRA My salad days
6161 When I was green in judgment cold in blood
6162 To say as I said then But come away
6163 Get me ink and paper
6164 He shall have every day a several greeting
6165 Or I'll unpeople Egypt Exeunt

6174 ACT II SCENE I
6175 Messina POMPEY'S house
6176 Enter POMPEY MENECRATES and MENAS in warlike manner
6177 POMPEY If the great gods be just they shall assist
6178 The deeds of justest men
6179 MENECRATES Know worthy Pompey
6180 That what they do delay they not deny
6181 POMPEY Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
6182 The thing we sue for
6183 MENECRATES We ignorant of ourselves
6184 Beg often our own harms which the wise pow'rs
6185 Deny us for our good so find we profit
6186 By losing of our prayers
6187 POMPEY I shall do well
6188 The people love me and the sea is mine
6189 My powers are crescent and my auguring hope
6190 Says it will come to th full Mark Antony
6191 In Egypt sits at dinner and will make
6192 No wars without doors Caesar gets money where
6193 He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both
6194 Of both is flatter'd but he neither loves
6195 Nor either cares for him
6196 MENAS Caesar and Lepidus
6197 Are in the field A mighty strength they carry
6198 POMPEY Where have you this 'Tis false
6199 MENAS From Silvius sir
6200 POMPEY He dreams I know they are in Rome together
6201 Looking for Antony But all the charms of love
6202 Salt Cleopatra soften thy wan'd lip
6203 Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
6204 Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
6205 Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks
6206 Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
6207 That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
6208 Even till a Lethe'd dullness
6209 Enter VARRIUS
6210 How now Varrius
6211 VARRIUS This is most certain that I shall deliver
6212 Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
6213 Expected Since he went from Egypt 'tis
6214 A space for farther travel
6215 POMPEY I could have given less matter
6216 A better ear Menas I did not think
6217 This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
6218 For such a petty war his soldiership
6219 Is twice the other twain But let us rear
6220 The higher our opinion that our stirring
6221 Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
6222 The ne'erlustwearied Antony
6223 MENAS I cannot hope
6224 Caesar and Antony shall well greet together
6225 His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar
6226 His brother warr'd upon him although I think
6227 Not mov'd by Antony
6228 POMPEY I know not Menas
6229 How lesser enmities may give way to greater
6230 Were't not that we stand up against them all
6231 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves
6232 For they have entertained cause enough
6233 To draw their swords But how the fear of us
6234 May cement their divisions and bind up
6235 The petty difference we yet not know
6236 Be't as our gods will have't It only stands
6237 Our lives upon to use our strongest hands
6238 Come Menas Exeunt
6239 SCENE II
6240 Rome The house of LEPIDUS
6241 Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
6242 LEPIDUS Good Enobarbus 'tis a worthy deed
6243 And shall become you well to entreat your captain
6244 To soft and gentle speech
6245 ENOBARBUS I shall entreat him
6246 To answer like himself If Caesar move him
6247 Let Antony look over Caesar's head
6248 And speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter
6249 Were I the wearer of Antonius beard
6250 I would not shave't today
6251 LEPIDUS 'Tis not a time
6252 For private stomaching
6253 ENOBARBUS Every time
6254 Serves for the matter that is then born in't
6255 LEPIDUS But small to greater matters must give way
6256 ENOBARBUS Not if the small come first
6257 LEPIDUS Your speech is passion
6258 But pray you stir no embers up Here comes
6259 The noble Antony
6260 Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
6261 ENOBARBUS And yonder Caesar
6262 Enter CAESAR MAECENAS and AGRIPPA
6263 ANTONY If we compose well here to Parthia
6264 Hark Ventidius
6265 CAESAR I do not know Maecenas Ask Agrippa
6266 LEPIDUS Noble friends
6267 That which combin'd us was most great and let not
6268 A leaner action rend us What's amiss
6269 May it be gently heard When we debate
6270 Our trivial difference loud we do commit
6271 Murder in healing wounds Then noble partners
6272 The rather for I earnestly beseech
6273 Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
6274 Nor curstness grow to th matter
6275 ANTONY 'Tis spoken well
6276 Were we before our arinies and to fight
6277 I should do thus [Flourish]
6278 CAESAR Welcome to Rome
6279 ANTONY Thank you
6280 CAESAR Sit
6281 ANTONY Sit sir
6282 CAESAR Nay then [They sit]
6283 ANTONY I learn you take things ill which are not so
6284 Or being concern you not
6285 CAESAR I must be laugh'd at
6286 If or for nothing or a little
6287 Should say myself offended and with you
6288 Chiefly i the world more laugh'd at that I should
6289 Once name you derogately when to sound your name
6290 It not concern'd me
6291 ANTONY My being in Egypt Caesar
6292 What was't to you
6293 CAESAR No more than my residing here at Rome
6294 Might be to you in Egypt Yet if you there
6295 Did practise on my state your being in Egypt
6296 Might be my question
6297 ANTONY How intend you practis'd
6298 CAESAR You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
6299 By what did here befall me Your wife and brother
6300 Made wars upon me and their contestation
6301 Was theme for you you were the word of war
6302 ANTONY You do mistake your business my brother never
6303 Did urge me in his act I did inquire it
6304 And have my learning from some true reports
6305 That drew their swords with you Did he not rather
6306 Discredit my authority with yours
6307 And make the wars alike against my stomach
6308 Having alike your cause Of this my letters
6309 Before did satisfy you If you'll patch a quarrel
6310 As matter whole you have not to make it with
6311 It must not be with this
6312 CAESAR You praise yourself
6313 By laying defects of judgment to me but
6314 You patch'd up your excuses
6315 ANTONY Not so not so
6316 I know you could not lack I am certain on't
6317 Very necessity of this thought that I
6318 Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought
6319 Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
6320 Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife
6321 I would you had her spirit in such another
6322 The third o th world is yours which with a snaffle
6323 You may pace easy but not such a wife
6324 ENOBARBUS Would we had all such wives that the men might go to
6325 wars with the women
6326 ANTONY So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar
6327 Made out of her impatience which not wanted
6328 Shrewdness of policy too I grieving grant
6329 Did you too much disquiet For that you must
6330 But say I could not help it
6331 CAESAR I wrote to you
6332 When rioting in Alexandria you
6333 Did pocket up my letters and with taunts
6334 Did gibe my missive out of audience
6335 ANTONY Sir
6336 He fell upon me ere admitted Then
6337 Three kings I had newly feasted and did want
6338 Of what I was i th morning but next day
6339 I told him of myself which was as much
6340 As to have ask'd him pardon Let this fellow
6341 Be nothing of our strife if we contend
6342 Out of our question wipe him
6343 CAESAR You have broken
6344 The article of your oath which you shall never
6345 Have tongue to charge me with
6346 LEPIDUS Soft Caesar
6347 ANTONY No
6348 Lepidus let him speak
6349 The honour is sacred which he talks on now
6350 Supposing that I lack'd it But on Caesar
6351 The article of my oath
6352 CAESAR To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them
6353 The which you both denied
6354 ANTONY Neglected rather
6355 And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
6356 From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may
6357 I'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty
6358 Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
6359 Work without it Truth is that Fulvia
6360 To have me out of Egypt made wars here
6361 For which myself the ignorant motive do
6362 So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
6363 To stoop in such a case
6364 LEPIDUS 'Tis noble spoken
6365 MAECENAS If it might please you to enforce no further
6366 The griefs between ye to forget them quite
6367 Were to remember that the present need
6368 Speaks to atone you
6369 LEPIDUS Worthily spoken Maecenas
6370 ENOBARBUS Or if you borrow one another's love for the instant
6371 you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again
6372 You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
6373 do
6374 ANTONY Thou art a soldier only Speak no more
6375 ENOBARBUS That truth should be silent I had almost forgot
6376 ANTONY You wrong this presence therefore speak no more
6377 ENOBARBUS Go to then your considerate stone
6378 CAESAR I do not much dislike the matter but
6379 The manner of his speech for't cannot be
6380 We shall remain in friendship our conditions
6381 So diff'ring in their acts Yet if I knew
6382 What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
6383 O th world I would pursue it
6384 AGRIPPA Give me leave Caesar
6385 CAESAR Speak Agrippa
6386 AGRIPPA Thou hast a sister by the mother's side
6387 Admir'd Octavia Great Mark Antony
6388 Is now a widower
6389 CAESAR Say not so Agrippa
6390 If Cleopatra heard you your reproof
6391 Were well deserv'd of rashness
6392 ANTONY I am not married Caesar Let me hear
6393 Agrippa further speak
6394 AGRIPPA To hold you in perpetual amity
6395 To make you brothers and to knit your hearts
6396 With an unslipping knot take Antony
6397 Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
6398 No worse a husband than the best of men
6399 Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
6400 That which none else can utter By this marriage
6401 All little jealousies which now seem great
6402 And all great fears which now import their dangers
6403 Would then be nothing Truths would be tales
6404 Where now half tales be truths Her love to both
6405 Would each to other and all loves to both
6406 Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke
6407 For 'tis a studied not a present thought
6408 By duty ruminated
6409 ANTONY Will Caesar speak
6410 CAESAR Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
6411 With what is spoke already
6412 ANTONY What power is in Agrippa
6413 If I would say 'Agrippa be it so'
6414 To make this good
6415 CAESAR The power of Caesar and
6416 His power unto Octavia
6417 ANTONY May I never
6418 To this good purpose that so fairly shows
6419 Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand
6420 Further this act of grace and from this hour
6421 The heart of brothers govern in our loves
6422 And sway our great designs
6423 CAESAR There is my hand
6424 A sister I bequeath you whom no brother
6425 Did ever love so dearly Let her live
6426 To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
6427 Fly off our loves again
6428 LEPIDUS Happily amen
6429 ANTONY I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey
6430 For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
6431 Of late upon me I must thank him only
6432 Lest my remembrance suffer ill report
6433 At heel of that defy him
6434 LEPIDUS Time calls upon's
6435 Of us must Pompey presently be sought
6436 Or else he seeks out us
6437 ANTONY Where lies he
6438 CAESAR About the Mount Misenum
6439 ANTONY What is his strength by land
6440 CAESAR Great and increasing but by sea
6441 He is an absolute master
6442 ANTONY So is the fame
6443 Would we had spoke together Haste we for it
6444 Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
6445 The business we have talk'd of
6446 CAESAR With most gladness
6447 And do invite you to my sister's view
6448 Whither straight I'll lead you
6449 ANTONY Let us Lepidus
6450 Not lack your company
6451 LEPIDUS Noble Antony
6452 Not sickness should detain me [Flourish]
6453 Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS AGRIPPA MAECENAS
6454 MAECENAS Welcome from Egypt sir
6455 ENOBARBUS Half the heart of Caesar worthy Maecenas My honourable
6456 friend Agrippa
6457 AGRIPPA Good Enobarbus
6458 MAECENAS We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
6459 digested You stay'd well by't in Egypt
6460 ENOBARBUS Ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made
6461 the night light with drinking
6462 MAECENAS Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but
6463 twelve persons there Is this true
6464 ENOBARBUS This was but as a fly by an eagle We had much more
6465 monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
6466 MAECENAS She's a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
6467 ENOBARBUS When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart
6468 upon the river of Cydnus
6469 AGRIPPA There she appear'd indeed Or my reporter devis'd well for
6470 her
6471 ENOBARBUS I will tell you
6472 The barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne
6473 Burn'd on the water The poop was beaten gold
6474 Purple the sails and so perfumed that
6475 The winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver
6476 Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
6477 The water which they beat to follow faster
6478 As amorous of their strokes For her own person
6479 It beggar'd all description She did lie
6480 In her pavilion clothofgold of tissue
6481 O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
6482 The fancy outwork nature On each side her
6483 Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids
6484 With diverscolour'd fans whose wind did seem
6485 To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
6486 And what they undid did
6487 AGRIPPA O rare for Antony
6488 ENOBARBUS Her gentlewomen like the Nereides
6489 So many mermaids tended her i th eyes
6490 And made their bends adornings At the helm
6491 A seeming mermaid steers The silken tackle
6492 Swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands
6493 That yarely frame the office From the barge
6494 A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
6495 Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast
6496 Her people out upon her and Antony
6497 Enthron'd i th marketplace did sit alone
6498 Whistling to th air which but for vacancy
6499 Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
6500 And made a gap in nature
6501 AGRIPPA Rare Egyptian
6502 ENOBARBUS Upon her landing Antony sent to her
6503 Invited her to supper She replied
6504 It should be better he became her guest
6505 Which she entreated Our courteous Antony
6506 Whom ne'er the word of 'No woman heard speak
6507 Being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast
6508 And for his ordinary pays his heart
6509 For what his eyes eat only
6510 AGRIPPA Royal wench
6511 She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
6512 He ploughed her and she cropp'd
6513 ENOBARBUS I saw her once
6514 Hop forty paces through the public street
6515 And having lost her breath she spoke and panted
6516 That she did make defect perfection
6517 And breathless pow'r breathe forth
6518 MAECENAS Now Antony must leave her utterly
6519 ENOBARBUS Never He will not
6520 Age cannot wither her nor custom stale
6521 Her infinite variety Other women cloy
6522 The appetites they feed but she makes hungry
6523 Where most she satisfies for vilest things
6524 Become themselves in her that the holy priests
6525 Bless her when she is riggish
6526 MAECENAS If beauty wisdom modesty can settle
6527 The heart of Antony Octavia is
6528 A blessed lottery to him
6529 AGRIPPA Let us go
6530 Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest
6531 Whilst you abide here

6557 Thy daemon that thy spirit which keeps thee is
6558 Noble courageous high unmatchable
6559 Where Caesar's is not but near him thy angel
6560 Becomes a fear as being o'erpow'r'd Therefore
6561 Make space enough between you

6563 SOOTHSAYER To none but thee no more but when to thee
6564 If thou dost play with him at any game
6565 Thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck
6566 He beats thee 'gainst the odds Thy lustre thickens
6567 When he shines by I say again thy spirit
6568 Is all afraid to govern thee near him

6573 He shall to Parthia Be it art or hap

6770 That else must perish here
6771 POMPEY To you all three
6772 The senators alone of this great world
6773 Chief factors for the gods I do not know
6774 Wherefore my father should revengers want
6775 Having a son and friends since Julius Caesar
6776 Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted
6777 There saw you labouring for him What was't
6778 That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire and what
6779 Made the allhonour'd honest Roman Brutus
6780 With the arm'd rest courtiers of beauteous freedom
6781 To drench the Capitol but that they would
6782 Have one man but a man And that is it
6783 Hath made me rig my navy at whose burden
6784 The anger'd ocean foams with which I meant
6785 To scourge th ingratitude that despiteful Rome

6809 ALL That's our offer
6810 POMPEY Know then
6811 I came before you here a man prepar'd
6812 To take this offer but Mark Antony
6813 Put me to some impatience Though I lose
6814 The praise of it by telling you must know
6815 When Caesar and your brother were at blows
6816 Your mother came to Sicily and did find
6817 Her welcome friendly
6818 ANTONY I have heard it Pompey
6819 And am well studied for a liberal thanks
6820 Which I do owe you
6821 POMPEY Let me have your hand
6822 I did not think sir to have met you here
6823 ANTONY The beds i th East are soft and thanks to you
6824 That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither

6826 CAESAR Since I saw you last
6827 There is a change upon you
6828 POMPEY Well I know not
6829 What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face

6834 I crave our composition may be written
6835 And seal'd between us
6836 CAESAR That's the next to do
6837 POMPEY We'll feast each other ere we part and let's
6838 Draw lots who shall begin
6839 ANTONY That will I Pompey
6840 POMPEY No Antony take the lot
6841 But first or last your fine Egyptian cookery
6842 Shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar
6843 Grew fat with feasting there
6844 ANTONY You have heard much
6845 POMPEY I have fair meanings sir
6846 ANTONY And fair words to them
6847 POMPEY Then so much have I heard
6848 And I have heard Apollodorus carried
6849 ENOBARBUS No more of that He did so
6850 POMPEY What I pray you
6851 ENOBARBUS A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress
6852 POMPEY I know thee now How far'st thou soldier

6861 When you have well deserv'd ten times as much
6862 As I have said you did
6863 POMPEY Enjoy thy plainness
6864 It nothing ill becomes thee
6865 Aboard my galley I invite you all
6866 Will you lead lords
6867 ALL Show's the way sir
6868 POMPEY Come Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
6869 MENAS [Aside] Thy father Pompey would ne'er have made this
6870 treaty You and I have known sir
6871 ENOBARBUS At sea I think
6872 MENAS We have sir
6873 ENOBARBUS You have done well by water
6874 MENAS And you by land
6875 ENOBARBUS I Will praise any man that will praise me though it
6876 cannot be denied what I have done by land
6877 MENAS Nor what I have done by water
6878 ENOBARBUS Yes something you can deny for your own safety you
6879 have been a great thief by sea
6880 MENAS And you by land
6881 ENOBARBUS There I deny my land service But give me your hand
6882 Menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two
6883 thieves kissing
6884 MENAS All men's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are
6885 ENOBARBUS But there is never a fair woman has a true face
6886 MENAS No slander they steal hearts
6887 ENOBARBUS We came hither to fight with you
6888 MENAS For my part I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking
6889 Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
6890 ENOBARBUS If he do sure he cannot weep't back again
6891 MENAS Y'have said sir We look'd not for Mark Antony here Pray
6892 you is he married to Cleopatra
6893 ENOBARBUS Caesar sister is call'd Octavia
6894 MENAS True sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellus
6895 ENOBARBUS But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius
6896 MENAS Pray ye sir
6897 ENOBARBUS 'Tis true
6898 MENAS Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together
6899 ENOBARBUS If I were bound to divine of this unity I would not
6900 prophesy so
6901 MENAS I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
6902 than the love of the parties
6903 ENOBARBUS I think so too But you shall find the band that seems
6904 to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
6905 their amity Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
6906 MENAS Who would not have his wife so
6907 ENOBARBUS Not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony He
6908 will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of Octavia
6909 blow the fire up in Caesar and as I said before that which is
6910 the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
6911 their variance Antony will use his affection where it is he
6912 married but his occasion here
6913 MENAS And thus it may be Come sir will you aboard I have a
6914 health for you
6915 ENOBARBUS I shall take it sir We have us'd our throats in Egypt

7111 One of my place in Syria his lieutenant

7116 The soldier's virtue rather makes choice of loss
7117 Than gain which darkens him

7755 CAESAR Let him appear that's come from Antony
7756 Know you him
7757 DOLABELLA Caesar 'tis his schoolmaster
7758 An argument that he is pluck'd when hither
7759 He sends so poor a pinion of his wing
7760 Which had superfluous kings for messengers
7761 Not many moons gone by
7762 Enter EUPHRONIUS Ambassador from ANTONY
7763 CAESAR Approach and speak
7764 EUPHRONIUS Such as I am I come from Antony
7765 I was of late as petty to his ends
7766 As is the morndew on the myrtle leaf
7767 To his grand sea
7768 CAESAR Be't so Declare thine office
7769 EUPHRONIUS Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and
7770 Requires to live in Egypt which not granted
7771 He lessens his requests and to thee sues
7772 To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
7773 A private man in Athens This for him
7774 Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness
7775 Submits her to thy might and of thee craves
7776 The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs
7777 Now hazarded to thy grace
7778 CAESAR For Antony
7779 I have no ears to his request The Queen
7780 Of audience nor desire shall fail so she
7781 From Egypt drive her alldisgraced friend

7790 In their best fortunes strong but want will perjure
7791 The ne'ertouch'd vestal Try thy cunning Thyreus
7792 Make thine own edict for thy pains which we
7793 Will answer as a law
7794 THYREUS Caesar I go

7803 CLEOPATRA What shall we do Enobarbus
7804 ENOBARBUS Think and die
7805 CLEOPATRA Is Antony or we in fault for this
7806 ENOBARBUS Antony only that would make his will
7807 Lord of his reason What though you fled
7808 From that great face of war whose several ranges
7809 Frighted each other Why should he follow
7810 The itch of his affection should not then
7811 Have nick'd his captainship at such a point
7812 When half to half the world oppos'd he being
7813 The mered question 'Twas a shame no less
7814 Than was his loss to course your flying flags
7815 And leave his navy gazing
7816 CLEOPATRA Prithee peace
7817 Enter EUPHRONIUS the Ambassador with ANTONY
7818 ANTONY Is that his answer
7819 EUPHRONIUS Ay my lord
7820 ANTONY The Queen shall then have courtesy so she
7821 Will yield us up
7822 EUPHRONIUS He says so
7823 ANTONY Let her know't
7824 To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head
7825 And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
7826 With principalities
7827 CLEOPATRA That head my lord
7828 ANTONY To him again Tell him he wears the rose
7829 Of youth upon him from which the world should note
7830 Something particular His coin ships legions
7831 May be a coward's whose ministers would prevail
7832 Under the service of a child as soon
7833 As i th command of Caesar I dare him therefore
7834 To lay his gay comparisons apart
7835 And answer me declin'd sword against sword
7836 Ourselves alone I'll write it Follow me
7837 Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
7838 EUPHRONIUS [Aside] Yes like enough highbattled Caesar will
7839 Unstate his happiness and be stag'd to th show
7840 Against a sworder I see men's judgments are
7841 A parcel of their fortunes and things outward
7842 Do draw the inward quality after them
7843 To suffer all alike That he should dream
7844 Knowing all measures the full Caesar will
7845 Answer his emptiness Caesar thou hast subdu'd
7846 His judgment too
7847 Enter a SERVANT
7848 SERVANT A messenger from Caesar
7849 CLEOPATRA What no more ceremony See my women
7850 Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
7851 That kneel'd unto the buds Admit him sir Exit SERVANT
7852 ENOBARBUS [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square
7853 The loyalty well held to fools does make
7854 Our faith mere folly Yet he that can endure
7855 To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
7856 Does conquer him that did his master conquer
7857 And earns a place i th story
7858 Enter THYREUS
7859 CLEOPATRA Caesar's will
7860 THYREUS Hear it apart
7861 CLEOPATRA None but friends say boldly
7862 THYREUS So haply are they friends to Antony
7863 ENOBARBUS He needs as many sir as Caesar has
7864 Or needs not us If Caesar please our master
7865 Will leap to be his friend For us you know
7866 Whose he is we are and that is Caesar's
7867 THYREUS So
7868 Thus then thou most renown'd Caesar entreats
7869 Not to consider in what case thou stand'st
7870 Further than he is Caesar
7871 CLEOPATRA Go on Right royal
7872 THYREUS He knows that you embrace not Antony
7873 As you did love but as you fear'd him
7874 CLEOPATRA O
7875 THYREUS The scars upon your honour therefore he
7876 Does pity as constrained blemishes
7877 Not as deserv'd
7878 CLEOPATRA He is a god and knows
7879 What is most right Mine honour was not yielded
7880 But conquer'd merely
7881 ENOBARBUS [Aside] To be sure of that
7882 I will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky
7883 That we must leave thee to thy sinking for
7884 Thy dearest quit thee Exit
7885 THYREUS Shall I say to Caesar
7886 What you require of him For he partly begs
7887 To be desir'd to give It much would please him
7888 That of his fortunes you should make a staff
7889 To lean upon But it would warm his spirits
7890 To hear from me you had left Antony
7891 And put yourself under his shroud
7892 The universal landlord
7893 CLEOPATRA What's your name
7894 THYREUS My name is Thyreus
7895 CLEOPATRA Most kind messenger
7896 Say to great Caesar this in deputation
7897 I kiss his conquring hand Tell him I am prompt
7898 To lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel
7899 Tell him from his allobeying breath I hear
7900 The doom of Egypt
7901 THYREUS 'Tis your noblest course
7902 Wisdom and fortune combating together
7903 If that the former dare but what it can
7904 No chance may shake it Give me grace to lay
7905 My duty on your hand
7906 CLEOPATRA Your Caesar's father oft
7907 When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in
7908 Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place
7909 As it rain'd kisses
7910 Reenter ANTONY and ENOBARBUS
7911 ANTONY Favours by Jove that thunders
7912 What art thou fellow
7913 THYREUS One that but performs
7914 The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
7915 To have command obey'd
7916 ENOBARBUS [Aside] You will be whipt
7917 ANTONY Approach there Ah you kite Now gods and devils
7918 Authority melts from me Of late when I cried 'Ho'
7919 Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth
7920 And cry 'Your will Have you no ears I am
7921 Antony yet
7922 Enter servants
7923 Take hence this Jack and whip him
7924 ENOBARBUS 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
7925 Than with an old one dying
7926 ANTONY Moon and stars

7928 That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them
7929 So saucy with the hand of she here what's her name
7930 Since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows
7931 Till like a boy you see him cringe his face
7932 And whine aloud for mercy Take him hence
7933 THYMUS Mark Antony
7934 ANTONY Tug him away Being whipt
7935 Bring him again the Jack of Caesar's shall
7936 Bear us an errand to him Exeunt servants with THYREUS
7937 You were half blasted ere I knew you Ha
7938 Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome
7939 Forborne the getting of a lawful race
7940 And by a gem of women to be abus'd
7941 By one that looks on feeders
7942 CLEOPATRA Good my lord
7943 ANTONY You have been a boggler ever
7944 But when we in our viciousness grow hard
7945 O misery on't the wise gods seel our eyes
7946 In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
7947 Adore our errors laugh at's while we strut
7948 To our confusion
7949 CLEOPATRA O is't come to this
7950 ANTONY I found you as a morsel cold upon
7951 Dead Caesar's trencher Nay you were a fragment
7952 Of Cneius Pompey's besides what hotter hours
7953 Unregist'red in vulgar fame you have
7954 Luxuriously pick'd out for I am sure
7955 Though you can guess what temperance should be
7956 You know not what it is
7957 CLEOPATRA Wherefore is this
7958 ANTONY To let a fellow that will take rewards
7959 And say 'God quit you be familiar with
7960 My playfellow your hand this kingly seal
7961 And plighter of high hearts O that I were
7962 Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
7963 The horned herd For I have savage cause
7964 And to proclaim it civilly were like
7965 A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
7966 For being yare about him
7967 Reenter a SERVANT with THYREUS
7968 Is he whipt
7969 SERVANT Soundly my lord
7970 ANTONY Cried he and begg'd 'a pardon
7971 SERVANT He did ask favour
7972 ANTONY If that thy father live let him repent
7973 Thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
7974 To follow Caesar in his triumph since
7975 Thou hast been whipt for following him Henceforth
7976 The white hand of a lady fever thee
7977 Shake thou to look on't Get thee back to Caesar
7978 Tell him thy entertainment look thou say
7979 He makes me angry with him for he seems
7980 Proud and disdainful harping on what I am
7981 Not what he knew I was He makes me angry
7982 And at this time most easy 'tis to do't
7983 When my good stars that were my former guides
7984 Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
7985 Into th abysm of hell If he mislike
7986 My speech and what is done tell him he has
7987 Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
7988 He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
7989 As he shall like to quit me Urge it thou
7990 Hence with thy stripes be gone Exit THYREUS
7991 CLEOPATRA Have you done yet
7992 ANTONY Alack our terrene moon
7993 Is now eclips'd and it portends alone
7994 The fall of Antony
7995 CLEOPATRA I must stay his time
7996 ANTONY To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes
7997 With one that ties his points
7998 CLEOPATRA Not know me yet
7999 ANTONY Coldhearted toward me
8000 CLEOPATRA Ah dear if I be so
8001 From my cold heart let heaven engender hail
8002 And poison it in the source and the first stone
8003 Drop in my neck as it determines so
8004 Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite
8005 Till by degrees the memory of my womb
8006 Together with my brave Egyptians all
8007 By the discandying of this pelleted storm
8008 Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile
8009 Have buried them for prey

8012 I will oppose his fate Our force by land
8013 Hath nobly held our sever'd navy to
8014 Have knit again and fleet threat'ning most sealike
8015 Where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady
8016 If from the field I shall return once more
8017 To kiss these lips I will appear in blood
8018 I and my sword will earn our chronicle
8019 There's hope in't yet
8020 CLEOPATRA That's my brave lord
8021 ANTONY I will be treblesinew'd hearted breath'd
8022 And fight maliciously For when mine hours
8023 Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
8024 Of me for jests but now I'll set my teeth

8031 Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra

8035 The wine peep through their scars Come on my queen
8036 There's sap in't yet The next time I do fight
8037 I'll make death love me for I will contend
8038 Even with his pestilent scythe Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
8039 ENOBARBUS Now he'll outstare the lightning To be furious
8040 Is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
8041 The dove will peck the estridge and I see still
8042 A diminution in our captain's brain

8761 The strongwing'd Mercury should fetch thee up
8762 And set thee by Jove's side Yet come a little
8763 Wishers were ever fools O come come
8764 [They heave ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
8765 And welcome welcome Die where thou hast liv'd
8766 Quicken with kissing Had my lips that power
8767 Thus would I wear them out
8768 ALL A heavy sight
8769 ANTONY I am dying Egypt dying
8770 Give me some wine and let me speak a little
8771 CLEOPATRA No let me speak and let me rail so high
8772 That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel
8773 Provok'd by my offence
8774 ANTONY One word sweet queen
8775 Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety O
8776 CLEOPATRA They do not go together
8777 ANTONY Gentle hear me
8778 None about Caesar trust but Proculeius
8779 CLEOPATRA My resolution and my hands I'll trust
8780 None about Caesar
8781 ANTONY The miserable change now at my end
8782 Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
8783 In feeding them with those my former fortunes
8784 Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o th world
8785 The noblest and do now not basely die
8786 Not cowardly put off my helmet to
8787 My countryman a Roman by a Roman
8788 Valiantly vanquish'd Now my spirit is going
8789 I can no more
8790 CLEOPATRA Noblest of men woo't die
8791 Hast thou no care of me Shall I abide
8792 In this dull world which in thy absence is
8793 No better than a sty O see my women [Antony dies]
8794 The crown o th earth doth melt My lord
8795 O wither'd is the garland of the war
8796 The soldier's pole is fall'n Young boys and girls
8797 Are level now with men The odds is gone
8798 And there is nothing left remarkable

8806 CHARMIAN Peace peace Iras
8807 CLEOPATRA No more but e'en a woman and commanded
8808 By such poor passion as the maid that milks
8809 And does the meanest chares It were for me
8810 To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
8811 To tell them that this world did equal theirs
8812 Till they had stol'n our jewel All's but nought
8813 Patience is sottish and impatience does
8814 Become a dog that's mad Then is it sin
8815 To rush into the secret house of death
8816 Ere death dare come to us How do you women
8817 What what good cheer Why how now Charmian
8818 My noble girls Ah women women look
8819 Our lamp is spent it's out Good sirs take heart
8820 We'll bury him and then what's brave what's noble
8821 Let's do it after the high Roman fashion
8822 And make death proud to take us Come away
8823 This case of that huge spirit now is cold
8824 Ah women women Come we have no friend

8837 CAESAR Wherefore is that And what art thou that dar'st
8838 Appear thus to us
8839 DERCETAS I am call'd Dercetas
8840 Mark Antony I serv'd who best was worthy
8841 Best to be serv'd Whilst he stood up and spoke
8842 He was my master and I wore my life
8843 To spend upon his haters If thou please
8844 To take me to thee as I was to him
8845 I'll be to Caesar if thou pleasest not
8846 I yield thee up my life
8847 CAESAR What is't thou say'st
8848 DERCETAS I say O Caesar Antony is dead
8849 CAESAR The breaking of so great a thing should make
8850 A greater crack The round world
8851 Should have shook lions into civil streets
8852 And citizens to their dens The death of Antony
8853 Is not a single doom in the name lay
8854 A moiety of the world
8855 DERCETAS He is dead Caesar
8856 Not by a public minister of justice
8857 Nor by a hired knife but that self hand
8858 Which writ his honour in the acts it did
8859 Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
8860 Splitted the heart This is his sword
8861 I robb'd his wound of it behold it stain'd
8862 With his most noble blood
8863 CAESAR Look you sad friends
8864 The gods rebuke me but it is tidings
8865 To wash the eyes of kings

8869 MAECENAS His taints and honours
8870 Wag'd equal with him
8871 AGRIPPA A rarer spirit never
8872 Did steer humanity But you gods will give us

8874 MAECENAS When such a spacious mirror's set before him
8875 He needs must see himself
8876 CAESAR O Antony
8877 I have follow'd thee to this But we do lance
8878 Diseases in our bodies I must perforce
8879 Have shown to thee such a declining day
8880 Or look on thine we could not stall together
8881 In the whole world But yet let me lament
8882 With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
8883 That thou my brother my competitor
8884 In top of all design my mate in empire
8885 Friend and companion in the front of war
8886 The arm of mine own body and the heart

8899 CAESAR Bid her have good heart
8900 She soon shall know of us by some of ours
8901 How honourable and how kindly we
8902 Determine for her for Caesar cannot learn
8903 To be ungentle
8904 EGYPTIAN So the gods preserve thee Exit
8905 CAESAR Come hither Proculeius Go and say
8906 We purpose her no shame Give her what comforts
8907 The quality of her passion shall require
8908 Lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke

8928 CLEOPATRA My desolation does begin to make
8929 A better life 'Tis paltry to be Caesar
8930 Not being Fortune he's but Fortune's knave
8931 A minister of her will and it is great
8932 To do that thing that ends all other deeds

8949 No less beg than a kingdom If he please

8959 A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
8960 Where he for grace is kneel'd to
8961 CLEOPATRA Pray you tell him
8962 I am his fortune's vassal and I send him
8963 The greatness he has got I hourly learn

8966 PROCULEIUS This I'll report dear lady
8967 Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied
8968 Of him that caus'd it
8969 GALLUS You see how easily she may be surpris'd

8987 Will never let come forth
8988 CLEOPATRA Where art thou death
8989 Come hither come Come come and take a queen
8990 Worth many babes and beggars
8991 PROCULEIUS O temperance lady
8992 CLEOPATRA Sir I will eat no meat I'll not drink sir
8993 If idle talk will once be necessary
8994 I'll not sleep neither This mortal house I'll ruin
8995 Do Caesar what he can Know sir that I
8996 Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court
8997 Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye
8998 Of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up
8999 And show me to the shouting varletry
9000 Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt
9001 Be gentle grave unto me Rather on Nilus mud
9002 Lay me starknak'd and let the waterflies
9003 Blow me into abhorring Rather make
9004 My country's high pyramides my gibbet
9005 And hang me up in chains
9006 PROCULEIUS You do extend
9007 These thoughts of horror further than you shall
9008 Find cause in Caesar
9009 Enter DOLABELLA
9010 DOLABELLA Proculeius
9011 What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows
9012 And he hath sent for thee For the Queen
9013 I'll take her to my guard
9014 PROCULEIUS So Dolabella
9015 It shall content me best Be gentle to her
9016 [To CLEOPATRA] To Caesar I will speak what you shall please
9017 If you'll employ me to him
9018 CLEOPATRA Say I would die
9019 Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldiers
9020 DOLABELLA Most noble Empress you have heard of me
9021 CLEOPATRA I cannot tell
9022 DOLABELLA Assuredly you know me
9023 CLEOPATRA No matter sir what I have heard or known
9024 You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
9025 Is't not your trick
9026 DOLABELLA I understand not madam
9027 CLEOPATRA I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony
9028 O such another sleep that I might see
9029 But such another man
9030 DOLABELLA If it might please ye
9031 CLEOPATRA His face was as the heav'ns and therein stuck
9032 A sun and moon which kept their course and lighted
9033 The little O the earth
9034 DOLABELLA Most sovereign creature
9035 CLEOPATRA His legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm
9036 Crested the world His voice was propertied
9037 As all the tuned spheres and that to friends
9038 But when he meant to quail and shake the orb
9039 He was as rattling thunder For his bounty
9040 There was no winter in't an autumn 'twas
9041 That grew the more by reaping His delights
9042 Were dolphinlike they show'd his back above
9043 The element they liv'd in In his livery
9044 Walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were
9045 As plates dropp'd from his pocket
9046 DOLABELLA Cleopatra
9047 CLEOPATRA Think you there was or might be such a man
9048 As this I dreamt of
9049 DOLABELLA Gentle madam no
9050 CLEOPATRA You lie up to the hearing of the gods
9051 But if there be nor ever were one such
9052 It's past the size of drearning Nature wants stuff
9053 To vie strange forms with fancy yet t imagine
9054 An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy
9055 Condemning shadows quite
9056 DOLABELLA Hear me good madam
9057 Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
9058 As answering to the weight Would I might never
9059 O'ertake pursu'd success but I do feel
9060 By the rebound of yours a grief that smites
9061 My very heart at root
9062 CLEOPATRA I thank you sir
9063 Know you what Caesar means to do with me
9064 DOLABELLA I am loath to tell you what I would you knew
9065 CLEOPATRA Nay pray you sir
9066 DOLABELLA Though he be honourable
9067 CLEOPATRA He'll lead me then in triumph

9080 The record of what injuries you did us
9081 Though written in our flesh we shall remember
9082 As things but done by chance
9083 CLEOPATRA Sole sir o th world
9084 I cannot project mine own cause so well
9085 To make it clear but do confess I have
9086 Been laden with like frailties which before
9087 Have often sham'd our sex
9088 CAESAR Cleopatra know
9089 We will extenuate rather than enforce
9090 If you apply yourself to our intents
9091 Which towards you are most gentle you shall find
9092 A benefit in this change but if you seek
9093 To lay on me a cruelty by taking
9094 Antony's course you shall bereave yourself
9095 Of my good purposes and put your children
9096 To that destruction which I'll guard them from
9097 If thereon you rely I'll take my leave
9098 CLEOPATRA And may through all the world 'Tis yours and we
9099 Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
9100 Hang in what place you please Here my good lord

9107 Upon his peril that I have reserv'd
9108 To myself nothing Speak the truth Seleucus
9109 SELEUCUS Madam
9110 I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
9111 Speak that which is not
9112 CLEOPATRA What have I kept back
9113 SELEUCUS Enough to purchase what you have made known
9114 CAESAR Nay blush not Cleopatra I approve
9115 Your wisdom in the deed
9116 CLEOPATRA See Caesar O behold
9117 How pomp is followed Mine will now be yours
9118 And should we shift estates yours would be mine
9119 The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
9120 Even make me wild O slave of no more trust
9121 Than love that's hir'd What goest thou back Thou shalt
9122 Go back I warrant thee but I'll catch thine eyes
9123 Though they had wings Slave soulless villain dog
9124 O rarely base
9125 CAESAR Good Queen let us entreat you
9126 CLEOPATRA O Caesar what a wounding shame is this
9127 That thou vouchsafing here to visit me
9128 Doing the honour of thy lordliness
9129 To one so meek that mine own servant should
9130 Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
9131 Addition of his envy Say good Caesar
9132 That I some lady trifles have reserv'd
9133 Immoment toys things of such dignity
9134 As we greet modern friends withal and say
9135 Some nobler token I have kept apart
9136 For Livia and Octavia to induce
9137 Their mediation must I be unfolded
9138 With one that I have bred The gods It smites me
9139 Beneath the fall I have [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence
9140 Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
9141 Through th ashes of my chance Wert thou a man
9142 Thou wouldst have mercy on me
9143 CAESAR Forbear Seleucus Exit SELEUCUS
9144 CLEOPATRA Be it known that we the greatest are misthought
9145 For things that others do and when we fall
9146 We answer others merits in our name
9147 Are therefore to be pitied
9148 CAESAR Cleopatra
9149 Not what you have reserv'd nor what acknowledg'd
9150 Put we i th roll of conquest Still be't yours
9151 Bestow it at your pleasure and believe
9152 Caesar's no merchant to make prize with you
9153 Of things that merchants sold Therefore be cheer'd

9225 What poor an instrument
9226 May do a noble deed He brings me liberty
9227 My resolution's plac'd and I have nothing

9229 I am marbleconstant now the fleeting moon

9231 Reenter GUARDSMAN and CLOWN with a basket
9232 GUARDSMAN This is the man
9233 CLEOPATRA Avoid and leave him Exit GUARDSMAN
9234 Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
9235 That kills and pains not
9236 CLOWN Truly I have him But I would not be the party that should
9237 desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that
9238 do die of it do seldom or never recover
9239 CLEOPATRA Remember'st thou any that have died on't
9240 CLOWN Very many men and women too I heard of one of them no
9241 longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given
9242 to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how
9243 she died of the biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes
9244 a very good report o th worm But he that will believe all that
9245 they say shall never be saved by half that they do But this is
9246 most falliable the worm's an odd worm
9247 CLEOPATRA Get thee hence farewell
9248 CLOWN I wish you all joy of the worm
9249 [Sets down the basket]
9250 CLEOPATRA Farewell
9251 CLOWN You must think this look you that the worm will do his
9252 kind
9253 CLEOPATRA Ay ay farewell
9254 CLOWN Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
9255 of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm
9256 CLEOPATRA Take thou no care it shall be heeded
9257 CLOWN Very good Give it nothing I pray you for it is not worth
9258 the feeding
9259 CLEOPATRA Will it eat me
9260 CLOWN You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
9261 himself will not eat a woman I know that a woman is a dish for
9262 the gods if the devil dress her not But truly these same
9263 whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in
9264 every ten that they make the devils mar five
9265 CLEOPATRA Well get thee gone farewell
9266 CLOWN Yes forsooth I wish you joy o th worm Exit
9267 Reenter IRAS with a robe crown &c
9268 CLEOPATRA Give me my robe put on my crown I have
9269 Immortal longings in me Now no more
9270 The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip
9271 Yare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hear
9272 Antony call I see him rouse himself
9273 To praise my noble act I hear him mock
9274 The luck of Caesar which the gods give men
9275 To excuse their after wrath Husband I come
9276 Now to that name my courage prove my title
9277 I am fire and air my other elements
9278 I give to baser life So have you done
9279 Come then and take the last warmth of my lips
9280 Farewell kind Charmian Iras long farewell
9281 [Kisses them IRAS falls and dies]
9282 Have I the aspic in my lips Dost fall
9283 If thus thou and nature can so gently part
9284 The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch
9285 Which hurts and is desir'd Dost thou lie still
9286 If thou vanishest thou tell'st the world
9287 It is not worth leavetaking
9288 CHARMIAN Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say
9289 The gods themselves do weep
9290 CLEOPATRA This proves me base
9291 If she first meet the curled Antony
9292 He'll make demand of her and spend that kiss
9293 Which is my heaven to have Come thou mortal wretch
9294 [To an asp which she applies to her breast]
9295 With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
9296 Of life at once untie Poor venomous fool
9297 Be angry and dispatch O couldst thou speak
9298 That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
9299 Unpolicied
9300 CHARMIAN O Eastern star
9301 CLEOPATRA Peace peace
9302 Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
9303 That sucks the nurse asleep
9304 CHARMIAN O break O break
9305 CLEOPATRA As sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle
9306 O Antony Nay I will take thee too
9307 [Applying another asp to her arm]
9308 What should I stay [Dies]
9309 CHARMIAN In this vile world So fare thee well
9310 Now boast thee death in thy possession lies
9311 A lass unparallel'd Downy windows close
9312 And golden Phoebus never be beheld
9313 Of eyes again so royal Your crown's awry
9314 I'll mend it and then play
9315 Enter the guard rushing in
9316 FIRST GUARD Where's the Queen
9317 CHARMIAN Speak softly wake her not
9318 FIRST GUARD Caesar hath sent
9319 CHARMIAN Too slow a messenger [Applies an asp]
9320 O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee
9321 FIRST GUARD Approach ho All's not well Caesar's beguil'd
9322 SECOND GUARD There's Dolabella sent from Caesar call him
9323 FIRST GUARD What work is here Charmian is this well done
9324 CHARMIAN It is well done and fitting for a princes
9325 Descended of so many royal kings
9326 Ah soldier [CHARMIAN dies]
9327 Reenter DOLABELLA
9328 DOLABELLA How goes it here
9329 SECOND GUARD All dead
9330 DOLABELLA Caesar thy thoughts
9331 Touch their effects in this Thyself art coming
9332 To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
9333 So sought'st to hinder
9334 [Within 'A way there a way for Caesar']
9335 Reenter CAESAR and all his train
9336 DOLABELLA O sir you are too sure an augurer
9337 That you did fear is done
9338 CAESAR Bravest at the last
9339 She levell'd at our purposes and being royal
9340 Took her own way The manner of their deaths
9341 I do not see them bleed
9342 DOLABELLA Who was last with them
9343 FIRST GUARD A simple countryman that brought her figs
9344 This was his basket
9345 CAESAR Poison'd then
9346 FIRST GUARD O Caesar
9347 This Charmian liv'd but now she stood and spake
9348 I found her trimming up the diadem
9349 On her dead mistress Tremblingly she stood
9350 And on the sudden dropp'd
9351 CAESAR O noble weakness
9352 If they had swallow'd poison 'twould appear
9353 By external swelling but she looks like sleep
9354 As she would catch another Antony
9355 In her strong toil of grace
9356 DOLABELLA Here on her breast
9357 There is a vent of blood and something blown
9358 The like is on her arm
9359 FIRST GUARD This is an aspic's trail and these figleaves
9360 Have slime upon them such as th aspic leaves
9361 Upon the caves of Nile
9362 CAESAR Most probable
9363 That so she died for her physician tells me
9364 She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite
9365 Of easy ways to die Take up her bed
9366 And bear her women from the monument
9367 She shall be buried by her Antony
9368 No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
9369 A pair so famous High events as these
9370 Strike those that make them and their story is
9371 No less in pity than his glory which
9372 Brought them to be lamented Our army shall
9373 In solemn show attend this funeral
9374 And then to Rome Come Dolabella see
9375 High order in this great solemnity Exeunt
9376 THE END

9421 ACT I SCENE I
9422 Orchard of OLIVER'S house
9423 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
9424 ORLANDO As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed
9425 me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou say'st
9426 charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there
9427 begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
9428 report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me
9429 rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at
9430 home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
9431 birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are
9432 bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding
9433 they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly
9434 hir'd but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for
9435 the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
9436 as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the
9437 something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
9438 me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
9439 brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my
9440 education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of
9441 my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against
9442 this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no
9443 wise remedy how to avoid it
9444 Enter OLIVER
9445 ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother
9446 ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
9447 up [ADAM retires]
9448 OLIVER Now sir what make you here
9449 ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make any thing
9450 OLIVER What mar you then sir
9451 ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a
9452 poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness
9453 OLIVER Marry sir be better employed and be nought awhile
9454 ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What
9455 prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury
9456 OLIVER Know you where you are sir
9457 ORLANDO O sir very well here in your orchard
9458 OLIVER Know you before whom sir
9459 ORLANDO Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are
9460 my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you
9461 should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better
9462 in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition takes not
9463 away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as
9464 much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming
9465 before me is nearer to his reverence
9466 OLIVER What boy [Strikes him]
9467 ORLANDO Come come elder brother you are too young in this
9468 OLIVER Wilt thou lay hands on me villain
9469 ORLANDO I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
9470 Boys He was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such
9471 a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not
9472 take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
9473 tongue for saying so Thou has rail'd on thyself
9474 ADAM [Coming forward] Sweet masters be patient for your father's
9475 remembrance be at accord
9476 OLIVER Let me go I say
9477 ORLANDO I will not till I please you shall hear me My father
9478 charg'd you in his will to give me good education you have
9479 train'd me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all
9480 gentlemanlike qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in
9481 me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow me such
9482 exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor
9483 allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy
9484 my fortunes
9485 OLIVER And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir
9486 get you in I will not long be troubled with you you shall have
9487 some part of your will I pray you leave me
9488 ORLANDO I no further offend you than becomes me for my good
9489 OLIVER Get you with him you old dog
9490 ADAM Is 'old dog my reward Most true I have lost my teeth in
9491 your service God be with my old master He would not have spoke
9492 such a word
9493 Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
9494 OLIVER Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I will physic
9495 your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla
9496 Dennis
9497 Enter DENNIS
9498 DENNIS Calls your worship
9499 OLIVER not Charles the Duke's wrestler here to speak with me
9500 DENNIS So please you he is here at the door and importunes access
9501 to you
9502 OLIVER Call him in [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way and
9503 tomorrow the wrestling is
9504 Enter CHARLES
9505 CHARLES Good morrow to your worship
9506 OLIVER Good Monsieur Charles What's the new news at the new
9507 court
9508 CHARLES There's no news at the court sir but the old news that
9509 is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke
9510 and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
9511 exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke
9512 therefore he gives them good leave to wander
9513 OLIVER Can you tell if Rosalind the Duke's daughter be banished
9514 with her father
9515 CHARLES O no for the Duke's daughter her cousin so loves her
9516 being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have
9517 followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at
9518 the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
9519 daughter and never two ladies loved as they do
9520 OLIVER Where will the old Duke live
9521 CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many
9522 merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood
9523 of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day
9524 and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world
9525 OLIVER What you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke
9526 CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
9527 matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger
9528 brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
9529 me to try a fall Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he
9530 that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well
9531 Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would
9532 be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come
9533 in therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint
9534 you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment
9535 or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is
9536 thing of his own search and altogether against my will
9537 OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt
9538 find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my
9539 brother's purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to
9540 dissuade him from it but he is resolute I'll tell thee
9541 Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of
9542 ambition an envious emulator of every man's good parts a secret
9543 and villainous contriver against me his natural brother
9544 Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his
9545 neck as his finger And thou wert best look to't for if thou
9546 dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace
9547 himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap
9548 thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he
9549 hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other for I
9550 assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one
9551 so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly
9552 of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush
9553 and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
9554 CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come
9555 tomorrow I'll give him his payment If ever he go alone again
9556 I'll never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your worship
9557 Exit
9558 OLIVER Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I
9559 hope I shall see an end of him for my soul yet I know not why
9560 hates nothing more than he Yet he's gentle never school'd and
9561 yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly
9562 beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and
9563 especially of my own people who best know him that I am
9564 altogether misprised But it shall not be so long this wrestler
9565 shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
9566 thither which now I'll go about Exit

9575 SCENE II
9576 A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
9577 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
9578 CELIA I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry
9579 ROSALIND Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and
9580 would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget
9581 a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any
9582 extraordinary pleasure
9583 CELIA Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
9584 love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy
9585 uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I
9586 could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst
9587 thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
9588 as mine is to thee
9589 ROSALIND Well I will forget the condition of my estate to
9590 rejoice in yours
9591 CELIA You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to
9592 have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what
9593 he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee
9594 again in affection By mine honour I will and when I break that
9595 oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet Rose my dear
9596 Rose be merry
9597 ROSALIND From henceforth I will coz and devise sports
9598 Let me see what think you of falling in love
9599 CELIA Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man
9600 in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety
9601 of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again
9602 ROSALIND What shall be our sport then
9603 CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
9604 wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
9605 ROSALIND I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily
9606 misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
9607 gifts to women
9608 CELIA 'Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
9609 honest and those that she makes honest she makes very
9610 illfavouredly
9611 ROSALIND Nay now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's
9612 Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of
9613 Nature
9614 Enter TOUCHSTONE
9615 CELIA No when Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by
9616 Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to
9617 flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
9618 the argument
9619 ROSALIND Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when
9620 Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutteroff of Nature's wit
9621 CELIA Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither but
9622 Nature's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
9623 such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for
9624 always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits How
9625 now wit Whither wander you
9626 TOUCHSTONE Mistress you must come away to your father
9627 CELIA Were you made the messenger
9628 TOUCHSTONE No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you
9629 ROSALIND Where learned you that oath fool
9630 TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
9631 good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught
9632 Now I'll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard
9633 was good and yet was not the knight forsworn
9634 CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
9635 ROSALIND Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
9636 TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear
9637 by your beards that I am a knave
9638 CELIA By our beards if we had them thou art
9639 TOUCHSTONE By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you
9640 swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this
9641 knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he
9642 had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
9643 that mustard
9644 CELIA Prithee who is't that thou mean'st
9645 TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick your father loves
9646 CELIA My father's love is enough to honour him Enough speak no
9647 more of him you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days
9648 TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
9649 men do foolishly
9650 CELIA By my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that
9651 fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have
9652 makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le Beau
9653 Enter LE BEAU
9654 ROSALIND With his mouth full of news
9655 CELIA Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
9656 ROSALIND Then shall we be newscramm'd
9657 CELIA All the better we shall be the more marketable Bon jour
9658 Monsieur Le Beau What's the news
9659 LE BEAU Fair Princess you have lost much good sport
9660 CELIA Sport of what colour
9661 LE BEAU What colour madam How shall I answer you
9662 ROSALIND As wit and fortune will
9663 TOUCHSTONE Or as the Destinies decrees
9664 CELIA Well said that was laid on with a trowel
9665 TOUCHSTONE Nay if I keep not my rank
9666 ROSALIND Thou losest thy old smell
9667 LE BEAU You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good
9668 wrestling which you have lost the sight of
9669 ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling
9670 LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning and if it please your
9671 ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and
9672 here where you are they are coming to perform it
9673 CELIA Well the beginning that is dead and buried
9674 LE BEAU There comes an old man and his three sons
9675 CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale
9676 LE BEAU Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
9677 ROSALIND With bills on their necks 'Be it known unto all men by
9678 these presents'
9679 LE BEAU The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Duke's
9680 wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of
9681 his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he serv'd
9682 the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man
9683 their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the
9684 beholders take his part with weeping
9685 ROSALIND Alas
9686 TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have
9687 lost
9688 LE BEAU Why this that I speak of
9689 TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time
9690 that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies
9691 CELIA Or I I promise thee
9692 ROSALIND But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
9693 his sides Is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking Shall we
9694 see this wrestling cousin
9695 LE BEAU You must if you stay here for here is the place
9696 appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it
9697 CELIA Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it
9698 Flourish Enter DUKE FREDERICK LORDS ORLANDO
9699 CHARLES and ATTENDANTS
9700 FREDERICK Come on since the youth will not be entreated his own
9701 peril on his forwardness
9702 ROSALIND Is yonder the man
9703 LE BEAU Even he madam
9704 CELIA Alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
9705 FREDERICK How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to
9706 see the wrestling
9707 ROSALIND Ay my liege so please you give us leave
9708 FREDERICK You will take little delight in it I can tell you
9709 there is such odds in the man In pity of the challenger's youth
9710 I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to
9711 him ladies see if you can move him
9712 CELIA Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau
9713 FREDERICK Do so I'll not be by
9714 [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
9715 LE BEAU Monsieur the Challenger the Princess calls for you
9716 ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty
9717 ROSALIND Young man have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler
9718 ORLANDO No fair Princess he is the general challenger I come
9719 but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth
9720 CELIA Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years
9721 You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength if you saw
9722 yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the
9723 fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
9724 enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own
9725 safety and give over this attempt
9726 ROSALIND Do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be
9727 misprised we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
9728 wrestling might not go forward
9729 ORLANDO I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts
9730 wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
9731 ladies any thing But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
9732 with me to my trial wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
9733 sham'd that was never gracious if kill'd but one dead that is
9734 willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none
9735 to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing only
9736 in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when
9737 I have made it empty
9738 ROSALIND The little strength that I have I would it were with
9739 you
9740 CELIA And mine to eke out hers
9741 ROSALIND Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you
9742 CELIA Your heart's desires be with you
9743 CHARLES Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
9744 lie with his mother earth
9745 ORLANDO Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
9746 FREDERICK You shall try but one fall
9747 CHARLES No I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a
9748 second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first
9749 ORLANDO You mean to mock me after you should not have mock'd me
9750 before but come your ways
9751 ROSALIND Now Hercules be thy speed young man
9752 CELIA I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the
9753 leg [They wrestle]
9754 ROSALIND O excellent young man
9755 CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should
9756 down
9757 [CHARLES is thrown Shout]
9758 FREDERICK No more no more
9759 ORLANDO Yes I beseech your Grace I am not yet well breath'd
9760 FREDERICK How dost thou Charles
9761 LE BEAU He cannot speak my lord
9762 FREDERICK Bear him away What is thy name young man
9763 ORLANDO Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
9764 Boys
9765 FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else
9766 The world esteem'd thy father honourable
9767 But I did find him still mine enemy
9768 Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed
9769 Hadst thou descended from another house
9770 But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
9771 I would thou hadst told me of another father
9772 Exeunt DUKE train and LE BEAU
9773 CELIA Were I my father coz would I do this
9774 ORLANDO I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son
9775 His youngest son and would not change that calling
9776 To be adopted heir to Frederick
9777 ROSALIND My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul
9778 And all the world was of my father's mind
9779 Had I before known this young man his son
9780 I should have given him tears unto entreaties
9781 Ere he should thus have ventur'd
9782 CELIA Gentle cousin
9783 Let us go thank him and encourage him
9784 My father's rough and envious disposition
9785 Sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserv'd
9786 If you do keep your promises in love
9787 But justly as you have exceeded all promise
9788 Your mistress shall be happy
9789 ROSALIND Gentleman [Giving him a chain from her neck]
9790 Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
9791 That could give more but that her hand lacks means
9792 Shall we go coz
9793 CELIA Ay Fare you well fair gentleman
9794 ORLANDO Can I not say 'I thank you My better parts
9795 Are all thrown down and that which here stands up
9796 Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
9797 ROSALIND He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes
9798 I'll ask him what he would Did you call sir
9799 Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
9800 More than your enemies
9801 CELIA Will you go coz
9802 ROSALIND Have with you Fare you well
9803 Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
9804 ORLANDO What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
9805 I cannot speak to her yet she urg'd conference
9806 O poor Orlando thou art overthrown
9807 Or Charles or something weaker masters thee
9808 Reenter LE BEAU
9809 LE BEAU Good sir I do in friendship counsel you
9810 To leave this place Albeit you have deserv'd
9811 High commendation true applause and love
9812 Yet such is now the Duke's condition
9813 That he misconstrues all that you have done
9814 The Duke is humorous what he is indeed
9815 More suits you to conceive than I to speak of
9816 ORLANDO I thank you sir and pray you tell me this
9817 Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
9818 That here was at the wrestling
9819 LE BEAU Neither his daughter if we judge by manners
9820 But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter
9821 The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke
9822 And here detain'd by her usurping uncle
9823 To keep his daughter company whose loves
9824 Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
9825 But I can tell you that of late this Duke
9826 Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece
9827 Grounded upon no other argument
9828 But that the people praise her for her virtues
9829 And pity her for her good father's sake
9830 And on my life his malice 'gainst the lady
9831 Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well
9832 Hereafter in a better world than this
9833 I shall desire more love and knowledge of you
9834 ORLANDO I rest much bounden to you fare you well
9835 Exit LE BEAU
9836 Thus must I from the smoke into the smother
9837 From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother
9838 But heavenly Rosalind Exit
9839 SCENE III
9840 The DUKE's palace
9841 Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
9842 CELIA Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy
9843 Not a word
9844 ROSALIND Not one to throw at a dog
9845 CELIA No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs
9846 throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
9847 ROSALIND Then there were two cousins laid up when the one should
9848 be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any
9849 CELIA But is all this for your father
9850 ROSALIND No some of it is for my child's father O how full of
9851 briers is this workingday world
9852 CELIA They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday
9853 foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats
9854 will catch them
9855 ROSALIND I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my
9856 heart
9857 CELIA Hem them away
9858 ROSALIND I would try if I could cry 'hem and have him
9859 CELIA Come come wrestle with thy affections
9860 ROSALIND O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
9861 CELIA O a good wish upon you You will try in time in despite of
9862 a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in
9863 good earnest Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall
9864 into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son
9865 ROSALIND The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly
9866 CELIA Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly
9867 By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his
9868 father dearly yet I hate not Orlando
9869 ROSALIND No faith hate him not for my sake
9870 CELIA Why should I not Doth he not deserve well
9871 Enter DUKE FREDERICK with LORDS
9872 ROSALIND Let me love him for that and do you love him because I
9873 do Look here comes the Duke
9874 CELIA With his eyes full of anger
9875 FREDERICK Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
9876 And get you from our court
9877 ROSALIND Me uncle
9878 FREDERICK You cousin
9879 Within these ten days if that thou beest found
9880 So near our public court as twenty miles
9881 Thou diest for it
9882 ROSALIND I do beseech your Grace
9883 Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
9884 If with myself I hold intelligence
9885 Or have acquaintance with mine own desires
9886 If that I do not dream or be not frantic
9887 As I do trust I am not then dear uncle
9888 Never so much as in a thought unborn
9889 Did I offend your Highness
9890 FREDERICK Thus do all traitors
9891 If their purgation did consist in words
9892 They are as innocent as grace itself
9893 Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not
9894 ROSALIND Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
9895 Tell me whereon the likelihood depends
9896 FREDERICK Thou art thy father's daughter there's enough
9897 ROSALIND SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom
9898 So was I when your Highness banish'd him
9899 Treason is not inherited my lord
9900 Or if we did derive it from our friends
9901 What's that to me My father was no traitor
9902 Then good my liege mistake me not so much
9903 To think my poverty is treacherous
9904 CELIA Dear sovereign hear me speak
9905 FREDERICK Ay Celia we stay'd her for your sake
9906 Else had she with her father rang'd along
9907 CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay
9908 It was your pleasure and your own remorse
9909 I was too young that time to value her
9910 But now I know her If she be a traitor
9911 Why so am I we still have slept together
9912 Rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together
9913 And wheresoe'er we went like Juno's swans
9914 Still we went coupled and inseparable
9915 FREDERICK She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
9916 Her very silence and her patience
9917 Speak to the people and they pity her
9918 Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name
9919 And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
9920 When she is gone Then open not thy lips
9921 Firm and irrevocable is my doom
9922 Which I have pass'd upon her she is banish'd
9923 CELIA Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
9924 I cannot live out of her company
9925 FREDERICK You are a fool You niece provide yourself
9926 If you outstay the time upon mine honour
9927 And in the greatness of my word you die
9928 Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
9929 CELIA O my poor Rosalind Whither wilt thou go
9930 Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine
9931 I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am
9932 ROSALIND I have more cause
9933 CELIA Thou hast not cousin
9934 Prithee be cheerful Know'st thou not the Duke
9935 Hath banish'd me his daughter
9936 ROSALIND That he hath not
9937 CELIA No hath not Rosalind lacks then the love
9938 Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
9939 Shall we be sund'red Shall we part sweet girl
9940 No let my father seek another heir
9941 Therefore devise with me how we may fly
9942 Whither to go and what to bear with us
9943 And do not seek to take your charge upon you
9944 To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
9945 For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
9946 Say what thou canst I'll go along with thee
9947 ROSALIND Why whither shall we go
9948 CELIA To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden
9949 ROSALIND Alas what danger will it be to us
9950 Maids as we are to travel forth so far
9951 Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
9952 CELIA I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
9953 And with a kind of umber smirch my face
9954 The like do you so shall we pass along
9955 And never stir assailants
9956 ROSALIND Were it not better
9957 Because that I am more than common tall
9958 That I did suit me all points like a man
9959 A gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh
9960 A boar spear in my hand and in my heart
9961 Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will
9962 We'll have a swashing and a martial outside
9963 As many other mannish cowards have
9964 That do outface it with their semblances
9965 CELIA What shall I call thee when thou art a man
9966 ROSALIND I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page
9967 And therefore look you call me Ganymede
9968 But what will you be call'd
9969 CELIA Something that hath a reference to my state
9970 No longer Celia but Aliena
9971 ROSALIND But cousin what if we assay'd to steal
9972 The clownish fool out of your father's court
9973 Would he not be a comfort to our travel
9974 CELIA He'll go along o'er the wide world with me
9975 Leave me alone to woo him Let's away
9976 And get our jewels and our wealth together
9977 Devise the fittest time and safest way
9978 To hide us from pursuit that will be made
9979 After my flight Now go we in content
9980 To liberty and not to banishment Exeunt

9989 ACT II SCENE I
9990 The Forest of Arden
9991 Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and two or three LORDS like foresters
9992 DUKE SENIOR Now my comates and brothers in exile
9993 Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
9994 Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods
9995 More free from peril than the envious court
9996 Here feel we not the penalty of Adam
9997 The seasons difference as the icy fang
9998 And churlish chiding of the winter's wind
9999 Which when it bites and blows upon my body
10000 Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say
10001 'This is no flattery these are counsellors
10002 That feelingly persuade me what I am'
10003 Sweet are the uses of adversity
10004 Which like the toad ugly and venomous
10005 Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
10006 And this our life exempt from public haunt
10007 Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
10008 Sermons in stones and good in everything
10009 I would not change it
10010 AMIENS Happy is your Grace
10011 That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
10012 Into so quiet and so sweet a style
10013 DUKE SENIOR Come shall we go and kill us venison
10014 And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
10015 Being native burghers of this desert city
10016 Should in their own confines with forked heads
10017 Have their round haunches gor'd
10018 FIRST LORD Indeed my lord
10019 The melancholy Jaques grieves at that
10020 And in that kind swears you do more usurp
10021 Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you
10022 Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
10023 Did steal behind him as he lay along
10024 Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
10025 Upon the brook that brawls along this wood
10026 To the which place a poor sequest'red stag
10027 That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt
10028 Did come to languish and indeed my lord
10029 The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
10030 That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
10031 Almost to bursting and the big round tears
10032 Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
10033 In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
10034 Much marked of the melancholy Jaques
10035 Stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook
10036 Augmenting it with tears
10037 DUKE SENIOR But what said Jaques
10038 Did he not moralize this spectacle
10039 FIRST LORD O yes into a thousand similes
10040 First for his weeping into the needless stream
10041 'Poor deer quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
10042 As worldlings do giving thy sum of more
10043 To that which had too much Then being there alone
10044 Left and abandoned of his velvet friends
10045 ''Tis right quoth he 'thus misery doth part
10046 The flux of company Anon a careless herd
10047 Full of the pasture jumps along by him
10048 And never stays to greet him 'Ay quoth Jaques
10049 'Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
10050 'Tis just the fashion Wherefore do you look
10051 Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there'
10052 Thus most invectively he pierceth through
10053 The body of the country city court
10054 Yea and of this our life swearing that we
10055 Are mere usurpers tyrants and what's worse
10056 To fright the animals and to kill them up
10057 In their assign'd and native dwellingplace
10058 DUKE SENIOR And did you leave him in this contemplation
10059 SECOND LORD We did my lord weeping and commenting
10060 Upon the sobbing deer
10061 DUKE SENIOR Show me the place
10062 I love to cope him in these sullen fits
10063 For then he's full of matter
10064 FIRST LORD I'll bring you to him straight Exeunt
10065 SCENE II
10066 The DUKE'S palace
10067 Enter DUKE FREDERICK with LORDS
10068 FREDERICK Can it be possible that no man saw them
10069 It cannot be some villains of my court
10070 Are of consent and sufferance in this
10071 FIRST LORD I cannot hear of any that did see her
10072 The ladies her attendants of her chamber
10073 Saw her abed and in the morning early
10074 They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress
10075 SECOND LORD My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
10076 Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing
10077 Hisperia the Princess gentlewoman
10078 Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
10079 Your daughter and her cousin much commend
10080 The parts and graces of the wrestler
10081 That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles
10082 And she believes wherever they are gone
10083 That youth is surely in their company
10084 FREDERICK Send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
10085 If he be absent bring his brother to me
10086 I'll make him find him Do this suddenly
10087 And let not search and inquisition quail
10088 To bring again these foolish runaways Exeunt
10089 SCENE III
10090 Before OLIVER'S house
10091 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting
10092 ORLANDO Who's there
10093 ADAM What my young master O my gentle master
10094 O my sweet master O you memory
10095 Of old Sir Rowland Why what make you here
10096 Why are you virtuous Why do people love you
10097 And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
10098 Why would you be so fond to overcome
10099 The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke
10100 Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
10101 Know you not master to some kind of men
10102 Their graces serve them but as enemies
10103 No more do yours Your virtues gentle master
10104 Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
10105 O what a world is this when what is comely
10106 Envenoms him that bears it
10107 ORLANDO Why what's the matter
10108 ADAM O unhappy youth
10109 Come not within these doors within this roof
10110 The enemy of all your graces lives
10111 Your brother no no brother yet the son
10112 Yet not the son I will not call him son
10113 Of him I was about to call his father
10114 Hath heard your praises and this night he means
10115 To burn the lodging where you use to lie
10116 And you within it If he fail of that
10117 He will have other means to cut you off
10118 I overheard him and his practices
10119 This is no place this house is but a butchery
10120 Abhor it fear it do not enter it
10121 ORLANDO Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go
10122 ADAM No matter whither so you come not here
10123 ORLANDO What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
10124 Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
10125 A thievish living on the common road
10126 This I must do or know not what to do
10127 Yet this I will not do do how I can
10128 I rather will subject me to the malice
10129 Of a diverted blood and bloody brother
10130 ADAM But do not so I have five hundred crowns
10131 The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father
10132 Which I did store to be my fosternurse
10133 When service should in my old limbs lie lame
10134 And unregarded age in corners thrown
10135 Take that and He that doth the ravens feed
10136 Yea providently caters for the sparrow
10137 Be comfort to my age Here is the gold
10138 All this I give you Let me be your servant
10139 Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
10140 For in my youth I never did apply
10141 Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
10142 Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
10143 The means of weakness and debility
10144 Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
10145 Frosty but kindly Let me go with you
10146 I'll do the service of a younger man
10147 In all your business and necessities
10148 ORLANDO O good old man how well in thee appears
10149 The constant service of the antique world
10150 When service sweat for duty not for meed
10151 Thou art not for the fashion of these times
10152 Where none will sweat but for promotion
10153 And having that do choke their service up
10154 Even with the having it is not so with thee
10155 But poor old man thou prun'st a rotten tree
10156 That cannot so much as a blossom yield
10157 In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
10158 But come thy ways we'll go along together
10159 And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
10160 We'll light upon some settled low content
10161 ADAM Master go on and I will follow the
10162 To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
10163 From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
10164 Here lived I but now live here no more
10165 At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
10166 But at fourscore it is too late a week
10167 Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
10168 Than to die well and not my master's debtor Exeunt
10169 SCENE IV
10170 The Forest of Arden
10171 Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE CELIA for ALIENA and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE
10172 ROSALIND O Jupiter how weary are my spirits
10173 TOUCHSTONE I Care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
10174 ROSALIND I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel
10175 and to cry like a woman but I must comfort the weaker vessel as
10176 doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat
10177 therefore courage good Aliena
10178 CELIA I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further
10179 TOUCHSTONE For my part I had rather bear with you than bear you
10180 yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you for I think you
10181 have no money in your purse
10182 ROSALIND Well this is the Forest of Arden
10183 TOUCHSTONE Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was at
10184 home I was in a better place but travellers must be content
10185 Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
10186 ROSALIND Ay be so good Touchstone Look you who comes here a
10187 young man and an old in solemn talk
10188 CORIN That is the way to make her scorn you still
10189 SILVIUS O Corin that thou knew'st how I do love her
10190 CORIN I partly guess for I have lov'd ere now
10191 SILVIUS No Corin being old thou canst not guess
10192 Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
10193 As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow
10194 But if thy love were ever like to mine
10195 As sure I think did never man love so
10196 How many actions most ridiculous
10197 Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
10198 CORIN Into a thousand that I have forgotten
10199 SILVIUS O thou didst then never love so heartily
10200 If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
10201 That ever love did make thee run into
10202 Thou hast not lov'd
10203 Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
10204 Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress praise
10205 Thou hast not lov'd
10206 Or if thou hast not broke from company
10207 Abruptly as my passion now makes me
10208 Thou hast not lov'd
10209 O Phebe Phebe Phebe Exit Silvius
10210 ROSALIND Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
10211 I have by hard adventure found mine own
10212 TOUCHSTONE And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke my
10213 sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming anight to
10214 Jane Smile and I remember the kissing of her batler and the
10215 cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd and I remember
10216 the wooing of peascod instead of her from whom I took two cods
10217 and giving her them again said with weeping tears 'Wear these
10218 for my sake We that are true lovers run into strange capers
10219 but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal
10220 in folly
10221 ROSALIND Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of
10222 TOUCHSTONE Nay I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
10223 my shins against it
10224 ROSALIND Jove Jove this shepherd's passion
10225 Is much upon my fashion
10226 TOUCHSTONE And mine but it grows something stale with me
10227 CELIA I pray you one of you question yond man
10228 If he for gold will give us any food
10229 I faint almost to death
10230 TOUCHSTONE Holla you clown
10231 ROSALIND Peace fool he's not thy Ensman
10232 CORIN Who calls
10233 TOUCHSTONE Your betters sir
10234 CORIN Else are they very wretched
10235 ROSALIND Peace I say Good even to you friend
10236 CORIN And to you gentle sir and to you all
10237 ROSALIND I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
10238 Can in this desert place buy entertainment
10239 Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
10240 Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
10241 And faints for succour
10242 CORIN Fair sir I pity her
10243 And wish for her sake more than for mine own
10244 My fortunes were more able to relieve her
10245 But I am shepherd to another man
10246 And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
10247 My master is of churlish disposition
10248 And little recks to find the way to heaven
10249 By doing deeds of hospitality
10250 Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
10251 Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
10252 By reason of his absence there is nothing
10253 That you will feed on but what is come see
10254 And in my voice most welcome shall you be
10255 ROSALIND What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
10256 CORIN That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
10257 That little cares for buying any thing
10258 ROSALIND I pray thee if it stand with honesty
10259 Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
10260 And thou shalt have to pay for it of us
10261 CELIA And we will mend thy wages I like this place
10262 And willingly could waste my time in it
10263 CORIN Assuredly the thing is to be sold
10264 Go with me if you like upon report
10265 The soil the profit and this kind of life
10266 I will your very faithful feeder be
10267 And buy it with your gold right suddenly Exeunt

10290 AMIENS More at your request than to please myself
10291 JAQUES Well then if ever I thank any man I'll thank you but
10292 that they call compliment is like th encounter of two dogapes
10293 and when a man thanks me heartily methinks have given him a
10294 penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks Come sing and you
10295 that will not hold your tongues
10296 AMIENS Well I'll end the song Sirs cover the while the Duke

10315 AMIENS And I'll sing it
10316 JAQUES Thus it goes
10317 If it do come to pass
10318 That any man turn ass
10319 Leaving his wealth and ease
10320 A stubborn will to please
10321 Ducdame ducdame ducdame

10334 ADAM Dear master I can go no further O I die for food Here lie
10335 I down and measure out my grave Farewell kind master
10336 ORLANDO Why how now Adam No greater heart in thee Live a
10337 little comfort a little cheer thyself a little If this uncouth
10338 forest yield anything savage I will either be food for it or
10339 bring it for food to thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
10340 powers For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the
10341 arm's end I will here be with the presently and if I bring thee
10342 not something to eat I will give thee leave to die but if thou

10344 thou look'st cheerly and I'll be with thee quickly Yet thou
10345 liest in the bleak air Come I will bear thee to some shelter
10346 and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live
10347 anything in this desert Cheerly good Adam Exeunt
10348 SCENE VII
10349 The forest
10350 A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and LORDS like outlaws
10351 DUKE SENIOR I think he be transform'd into a beast
10352 For I can nowhere find him like a man
10353 FIRST LORD My lord he is but even now gone hence
10354 Here was he merry hearing of a song
10355 DUKE SENIOR If he compact of jars grow musical
10356 We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
10357 Go seek him tell him I would speak with him
10358 Enter JAQUES
10359 FIRST LORD He saves my labour by his own approach
10360 DUKE SENIOR Why how now monsieur what a life is this
10361 That your poor friends must woo your company
10362 What you look merrily
10363 JAQUES A fool a fool I met a fool i th forest
10364 A motley fool A miserable world
10365 As I do live by food I met a fool
10366 Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
10367 And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms
10368 In good set terms and yet a motley fool
10369 'Good morrow fool quoth I 'No sir quoth he
10370 'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune'
10371 And then he drew a dial from his poke
10372 And looking on it with lacklustre eye
10373 Says very wisely 'It is ten o'clock
10374 Thus we may see quoth he 'how the world wags
10375 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
10376 And after one hour more 'twill be eleven
10377 And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
10378 And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
10379 And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
10380 The motley fool thus moral on the time
10381 My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
10382 That fools should be so deep contemplative
10383 And I did laugh sans intermission
10384 An hour by his dial O noble fool
10385 A worthy fool Motley's the only wear
10386 DUKE SENIOR What fool is this
10387 JAQUES O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
10388 And says if ladies be but young and fair
10389 They have the gift to know it and in his brain
10390 Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
10391 After a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd
10392 With observation the which he vents
10393 In mangled forms O that I were a fool
10394 I am ambitious for a motley coat
10395 DUKE SENIOR Thou shalt have one
10396 JAQUES It is my only suit
10397 Provided that you weed your better judgments
10398 Of all opinion that grows rank in them
10399 That I am wise I must have liberty
10400 Withal as large a charter as the wind
10401 To blow on whom I please for so fools have
10402 And they that are most galled with my folly
10403 They most must laugh And why sir must they so
10404 The why is plain as way to parish church
10405 He that a fool doth very wisely hit
10406 Doth very foolishly although he smart
10407 Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
10408 The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
10409 Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool
10410 Invest me in my motley give me leave
10411 To speak my mind and I will through and through
10412 Cleanse the foul body of th infected world
10413 If they will patiently receive my medicine
10414 DUKE SENIOR Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do
10415 JAQUES What for a counter would I do but good
10416 DUKE SENIOR Most Mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
10417 For thou thyself hast been a libertine
10418 As sensual as the brutish sting itself
10419 And all th embossed sores and headed evils
10420 That thou with license of free foot hast caught
10421 Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
10422 JAQUES Why who cries out on pride
10423 That can therein tax any private party
10424 Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
10425 Till that the wearer's very means do ebb
10426 What woman in the city do I name
10427 When that I say the citywoman bears
10428 The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
10429 Who can come in and say that I mean her
10430 When such a one as she such is her neighbour
10431 Or what is he of basest function
10432 That says his bravery is not on my cost
10433 Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
10434 His folly to the mettle of my speech
10435 There then how then what then Let me see wherein
10436 My tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right
10437 Then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free
10438 Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
10439 Unclaim'd of any man But who comes here
10440 Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
10441 ORLANDO Forbear and eat no more
10442 JAQUES Why I have eat none yet
10443 ORLANDO Nor shalt not till necessity be serv'd
10444 JAQUES Of what kind should this cock come of
10445 DUKE SENIOR Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress
10446 Or else a rude despiser of good manners
10447 That in civility thou seem'st so empty
10448 ORLANDO You touch'd my vein at first the thorny point
10449 Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
10450 Of smooth civility yet arn I inland bred
10451 And know some nurture But forbear I say
10452 He dies that touches any of this fruit
10453 Till I and my affairs are answered
10454 JAQUES An you will not be answer'd with reason I must die
10455 DUKE SENIOR What would you have Your gentleness shall force
10456 More than your force move us to gentleness
10457 ORLANDO I almost die for food and let me have it
10458 DUKE SENIOR Sit down and feed and welcome to our table
10459 ORLANDO Speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you
10460 I thought that all things had been savage here
10461 And therefore put I on the countenance
10462 Of stern commandment But whate'er you are
10463 That in this desert inaccessible
10464 Under the shade of melancholy boughs
10465 Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
10466 If ever you have look'd on better days
10467 If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church
10468 If ever sat at any good man's feast
10469 If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear
10470 And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied
10471 Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
10472 In the which hope I blush and hide my sword
10473 DUKE SENIOR True is it that we have seen better days
10474 And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
10475 And sat at good men's feasts and wip'd our eyes
10476 Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red
10477 And therefore sit you down in gentleness
10478 And take upon command what help we have
10479 That to your wanting may be minist'red
10480 ORLANDO Then but forbear your food a little while
10481 Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
10482 And give it food There is an old poor man
10483 Who after me hath many a weary step
10484 Limp'd in pure love till he be first suffic'd
10485 Oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger
10486 I will not touch a bit
10487 DUKE SENIOR Go find him out
10488 And we will nothing waste till you return
10489 ORLANDO I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
10490 Exit
10491 DUKE SENIOR Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
10492 This wide and universal theatre
10493 Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
10494 Wherein we play in
10495 JAQUES All the world's a stage
10496 And all the men and women merely players
10497 They have their exits and their entrances
10498 And one man in his time plays many parts
10499 His acts being seven ages At first the infant
10500 Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms
10501 Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
10502 And shining morning face creeping like snail
10503 Unwillingly to school And then the lover
10504 Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
10505 Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
10506 Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
10507 Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
10508 Seeking the bubble reputation
10509 Even in the cannon's mouth And then the justice
10510 In fair round belly with good capon lin'd
10511 With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
10512 Full of wise saws and modern instances
10513 And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
10514 Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
10515 With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
10516 His youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide
10517 For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
10518 Turning again toward childish treble pipes
10519 And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
10520 That ends this strange eventful history
10521 Is second childishness and mere oblivion
10522 Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing
10523 Reenter ORLANDO with ADAM
10524 DUKE SENIOR Welcome Set down your venerable burden
10525 And let him feed
10526 ORLANDO I thank you most for him
10527 ADAM So had you need
10528 I scarce can speak to thank you for myself
10529 DUKE SENIOR Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
10530 As yet to question you about your fortunes
10531 Give us some music and good cousin sing
10532 SONG
10533 Blow blow thou winter wind
10534 Thou art not so unkind
10535 As man's ingratitude
10536 Thy tooth is not so keen
10537 Because thou art not seen
10538 Although thy breath be rude
10539 Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
10540 Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
10541 Then heighho the holly
10542 This life is most jolly
10543 Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
10544 That dost not bite so nigh
10545 As benefits forgot
10546 Though thou the waters warp
10547 Thy sting is not so sharp
10548 As friend rememb'red not
10549 Heighho sing &c
10550 DUKE SENIOR If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son
10551 As you have whisper'd faithfully you were
10552 And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
10553 Most truly limn'd and living in your face
10554 Be truly welcome hither I am the Duke
10555 That lov'd your father The residue of your fortune
10556 Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
10557 Thou art right welcome as thy master is
10558 Support him by the arm Give me your hand
10559 And let me all your fortunes understand Exeunt

10561 The palace
10562 Enter DUKE FREDERICK OLIVER and LORDS
10563 FREDERICK Not see him since Sir sir that cannot be
10564 But were I not the better part made mercy
10565 I should not seek an absent argument
10566 Of my revenge thou present But look to it
10567 Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is
10568 Seek him with candle bring him dead or living
10569 Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more
10570 To seek a living in our territory
10571 Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
10572 Worth seizure do we seize into our hands
10573 Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
10574 Of what we think against thee
10575 OLIVER O that your Highness knew my heart in this
10576 I never lov'd my brother in my life
10577 FREDERICK More villain thou Well push him out of doors
10578 And let my officers of such a nature
10579 Make an extent upon his house and lands
10580 Do this expediently and turn him going Exeunt
10581 SCENE II
10582 The forest
10583 Enter ORLANDO with a paper
10584 ORLANDO Hang there my verse in witness of my love
10585 And thou thricecrowned Queen of Night survey
10586 With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
10587 Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
10588 O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
10589 And in their barks my thoughts I'll character
10590 That every eye which in this forest looks
10591 Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where
10592 Run run Orlando carve on every tree
10593 The fair the chaste and unexpressive she Exit
10594 Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
10595 CORIN And how like you this shepherd's life Master Touchstone
10596 TOUCHSTONE Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
10597 life but in respect that it is a shepherd's life it is nought
10598 In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in
10599 respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in
10600 respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect
10601 it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life
10602 look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty
10603 in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in
10604 thee shepherd
10605 CORIN No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
10606 ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is
10607 without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet
10608 and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
10609 great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath
10610 learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding
10611 or comes of a very dull kindred
10612 TOUCHSTONE Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in
10613 court shepherd
10614 CORIN No truly
10615 TOUCHSTONE Then thou art damn'd
10616 CORIN Nay I hope
10617 TOUCHSTONE Truly thou art damn'd like an illroasted egg all on
10618 one side
10619 CORIN For not being at court Your reason
10620 TOUCHSTONE Why if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
10621 manners if thou never saw'st good manners then thy manners must
10622 be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation Thou art
10623 in a parlous state shepherd
10624 CORIN Not a whit Touchstone Those that are good manners at the
10625 court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
10626 country is most mockable at the court You told me you salute not
10627 at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
10628 uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
10629 TOUCHSTONE Instance briefly come instance
10630 CORIN Why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you
10631 know are greasy
10632 TOUCHSTONE Why do not your courtier's hands sweat And is not the
10633 grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow
10634 shallow A better instance I say come
10635 CORIN Besides our hands are hard
10636 TOUCHSTONE Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again A
10637 more sounder instance come
10638 CORIN And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
10639 sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtier's hands are
10640 perfum'd with civet
10641 TOUCHSTONE Most shallow man thou worm's meat in respect of a good
10642 piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend civet is
10643 of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend
10644 the instance shepherd
10645 CORIN You have too courtly a wit for me I'll rest
10646 TOUCHSTONE Wilt thou rest damn'd God help thee shallow man God
10647 make incision in thee thou art raw
10648 CORIN Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I
10649 wear owe no man hate envy no man's happiness glad of other
10650 men's good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is
10651 to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck
10652 TOUCHSTONE That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
10653 and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the
10654 copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray
10655 a shelamb of a twelvemonth to crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
10656 out of all reasonable match If thou beest not damn'd for this
10657 the devil himself will have no shepherds I cannot see else how
10658 thou shouldst scape
10659 CORIN Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistress's brother
10660 Enter ROSALIND reading a paper
10661 ROSALIND 'From the east to western Inde
10662 No jewel is like Rosalinde
10663 Her worth being mounted on the wind
10664 Through all the world bears Rosalinde
10665 All the pictures fairest lin'd
10666 Are but black to Rosalinde
10667 Let no face be kept in mind
10668 But the fair of Rosalinde'
10669 TOUCHSTONE I'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
10670 suppers and sleeping hours excepted It is the right
10671 butterwomen's rank to market
10672 ROSALIND Out fool
10673 TOUCHSTONE For a taste
10674 If a hart do lack a hind
10675 Let him seek out Rosalinde
10676 If the cat will after kind
10677 So be sure will Rosalinde
10678 Winter garments must be lin'd
10679 So must slender Rosalinde
10680 They that reap must sheaf and bind
10681 Then to cart with Rosalinde
10682 Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
10683 Such a nut is Rosalinde
10684 He that sweetest rose will find
10685 Must find love's prick and Rosalinde
10686 This is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect
10687 yourself with them
10688 ROSALIND Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree
10689 TOUCHSTONE Truly the tree yields bad fruit
10690 ROSALIND I'll graff it with you and then I shall graff it with a
10691 medlar Then it will be the earliest fruit i th country for
10692 you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe and that's the right
10693 virtue of the medlar
10694 TOUCHSTONE You have said but whether wisely or no let the forest
10695 judge
10696 Enter CELIA with a writing
10697 ROSALIND Peace
10698 Here comes my sister reading stand aside
10699 CELIA 'Why should this a desert be
10700 For it is unpeopled No
10701 Tongues I'll hang on every tree
10702 That shall civil sayings show
10703 Some how brief the life of man
10704 Runs his erring pilgrimage
10705 That the streching of a span
10706 Buckles in his sum of age
10707 Some of violated vows
10708 'Twixt the souls of friend and friend
10709 But upon the fairest boughs
10710 Or at every sentence end
10711 Will I Rosalinda write
10712 Teaching all that read to know
10713 The quintessence of every sprite
10714 Heaven would in little show
10715 Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
10716 That one body should be fill'd
10717 With all graces wideenlarg'd
10718 Nature presently distill'd
10719 Helen's cheek but not her heart
10720 Cleopatra's majesty
10721 Atalanta's better part
10722 Sad Lucretia's modesty
10723 Thus Rosalinde of many parts
10724 By heavenly synod was devis'd
10725 Of many faces eyes and hearts
10726 To have the touches dearest priz'd
10727 Heaven would that she these gifts should have
10728 And I to live and die her slave'
10729 ROSALIND O most gentle pulpiter What tedious homily of love have
10730 you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried 'Have
10731 patience good people'
10732 CELIA How now Back friends shepherd go off a little go with
10733 him sirrah
10734 TOUCHSTONE Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
10735 though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
10736 Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
10737 CELIA Didst thou hear these verses
10738 ROSALIND O yes I heard them all and more too for some of them
10739 had in them more feet than the verses would bear
10740 CELIA That's no matter the feet might bear the verses
10741 ROSALIND Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves
10742 without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse
10743 CELIA But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
10744 hang'd and carved upon these trees
10745 ROSALIND I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
10746 came for look here what I found on a palmtree I was never so
10747 berhym'd since Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I
10748 can hardly remember
10749 CELIA Trow you who hath done this
10750 ROSALIND Is it a man
10751 CELIA And a chain that you once wore about his neck
10752 Change you colour
10753 ROSALIND I prithee who
10754 CELIA O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but
10755 mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes and so encounter
10756 ROSALIND Nay but who is it
10757 CELIA Is it possible
10758 ROSALIND Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell
10759 me who it is
10760 CELIA O wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet
10761 again wonderful and after that out of all whooping
10762 ROSALIND Good my complexion dost thou think though I am
10763 caparison'd like a man I have a doublet and hose in my
10764 disposition One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery
10765 I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would
10766 thou could'st stammer that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man
10767 out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrowmouth'd bottle
10768 either too much at once or none at all I prithee take the cork
10769 out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings
10770 CELIA So you may put a man in your belly
10771 ROSALIND Is he of God's making What manner of man
10772 Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
10773 CELIA Nay he hath but a little beard
10774 ROSALIND Why God will send more if the man will be thankful Let
10775 me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the
10776 knowledge of his chin
10777 CELIA It is young Orlando that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
10778 and your heart both in an instant
10779 ROSALIND Nay but the devil take mocking Speak sad brow and true
10780 maid
10781 CELIA I faith coz 'tis he
10782 ROSALIND Orlando
10783 CELIA Orlando
10784 ROSALIND Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and hose
10785 What did he when thou saw'st him What said he How look'd he
10786 Wherein went he What makes he here Did he ask for me Where
10787 remains he How parted he with thee And when shalt thou see him
10788 again Answer me in one word
10789 CELIA You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first 'tis a word too
10790 great for any mouth of this age's size To say ay and no to these
10791 particulars is more than to answer in a catechism
10792 ROSALIND But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man's
10793 apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
10794 CELIA It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
10795 propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and
10796 relish it with good observance I found him under a tree like a
10797 dropp'd acorn
10798 ROSALIND It may well be call'd Jove's tree when it drops forth
10799 such fruit
10800 CELIA Give me audience good madam
10801 ROSALIND Proceed
10802 CELIA There lay he stretch'd along like a wounded knight
10803 ROSALIND Though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes
10804 the ground
10805 CELIA Cry 'Holla to thy tongue I prithee it curvets
10806 unseasonably He was furnish'd like a hunter
10807 ROSALIND O ominous he comes to kill my heart
10808 CELIA I would sing my song without a burden thou bring'st me out
10809 of tune
10810 ROSALIND Do you not know I am a woman When I think I must speak
10811 Sweet say on
10812 CELIA You bring me out Soft comes he not here
10813 Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
10814 ROSALIND 'Tis he slink by and note him
10815 JAQUES I thank you for your company but good faith I had as
10816 lief have been myself alone
10817 ORLANDO And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too
10818 for your society
10819 JAQUES God buy you let's meet as little as we can
10820 ORLANDO I do desire we may be better strangers
10821 JAQUES I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
10822 their barks
10823 ORLANDO I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
10824 illfavouredly
10825 JAQUES Rosalind is your love's name
10826 ORLANDO Yes just
10827 JAQUES I do not like her name
10828 ORLANDO There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
10829 christen'd
10830 JAQUES What stature is she of
10831 ORLANDO Just as high as my heart
10832 JAQUES You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
10833 acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conn'd them out of rings
10834 ORLANDO Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence
10835 you have studied your questions
10836 JAQUES You have a nimble wit I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
10837 heels Will you sit down with me and we two will rail against
10838 our mistress the world and all our misery
10839 ORLANDO I will chide no breather in the world but myself against
10840 whom I know most faults
10841 JAQUES The worst fault you have is to be in love
10842 ORLANDO 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue I am
10843 weary of you
10844 JAQUES By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found you
10845 ORLANDO He is drown'd in the brook look but in and you shall see
10846 him
10847 JAQUES There I shall see mine own figure
10848 ORLANDO Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher
10849 JAQUES I'll tarry no longer with you farewell good Signior Love
10850 ORLANDO I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
10851 Melancholy
10852 Exit JAQUES
10853 ROSALIND [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey
10854 and under that habit play the knave with him Do you hear
10855 forester
10856 ORLANDO Very well what would you
10857 ROSALIND I pray you what is't o'clock
10858 ORLANDO You should ask me what time o day there's no clock in
10859 the forest
10860 ROSALIND Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing
10861 every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
10862 of Time as well as a clock
10863 ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of Time Had not that been as
10864 proper
10865 ROSALIND By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
10866 divers persons I'll tell you who Time ambles withal who Time
10867 trots withal who Time gallops withal and who he stands still
10868 withal
10869 ORLANDO I prithee who doth he trot withal
10870 ROSALIND Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
10871 contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd if the
10872 interim be but a se'nnight Time's pace is so hard that it seems
10873 the length of seven year
10874 ORLANDO Who ambles Time withal
10875 ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
10876 not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study
10877 and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one
10878 lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other
10879 knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These Time ambles
10880 withal
10881 ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal
10882 ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly
10883 as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
10884 ORLANDO Who stays it still withal
10885 ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term
10886 and term and then they perceive not how Time moves
10887 ORLANDO Where dwell you pretty youth
10888 ROSALIND With this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of
10889 the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
10890 ORLANDO Are you native of this place
10891 ROSALIND As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled
10892 ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
10893 so removed a dwelling
10894 ROSALIND I have been told so of many but indeed an old religious
10895 uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland
10896 man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love
10897 I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I
10898 am not a woman to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
10899 hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal
10900 ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
10901 to the charge of women
10902 ROSALIND There were none principal they were all like one another
10903 as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his
10904 fellowfault came to match it
10905 ORLANDO I prithee recount some of them
10906 ROSALIND No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
10907 sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
10908 plants with carving 'Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon
10909 hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the
10910 name of Rosalind If I could meet that fancymonger I would give
10911 him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love
10912 upon him
10913 ORLANDO I am he that is so loveshak'd I pray you tell me your
10914 remedy
10915 ROSALIND There is none of my uncle's marks upon you he taught me
10916 how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you
10917 are not prisoner
10918 ORLANDO What were his marks
10919 ROSALIND A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken
10920 which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not
10921 a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that
10922 for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue
10923 Then your hose should be ungarter'd your bonnet unbanded your
10924 sleeve unbutton'd your shoe untied and every thing about you
10925 demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man you
10926 are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself
10927 than seeming the lover of any other
10928 ORLANDO Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love
10929 ROSALIND Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love
10930 believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess
10931 she does That is one of the points in the which women still give
10932 the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that
10933 hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired
10934 ORLANDO I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I
10935 am that he that unfortunate he
10936 ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
10937 ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
10938 ROSALIND Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as
10939 well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why
10940 they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
10941 ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing
10942 it by counsel
10943 ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so
10944 ROSALIND Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his
10945 love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which
10946 time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate
10947 changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish
10948 shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
10949 passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and
10950 women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like
10951 him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now
10952 weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his
10953 mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to
10954 forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
10955 merely monastic And thus I cur'd him and this way will I take
10956 upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart
10957 that there shall not be one spot of love in 't
10958 ORLANDO I would not be cured youth
10959 ROSALIND I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and
10960 come every day to my cote and woo me
10961 ORLANDO Now by the faith of my love I will Tell me where it is
10962 ROSALIND Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
10963 you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you go
10964 ORLANDO With all my heart good youth
10965 ROSALIND Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you
10966 go Exeunt
10967 SCENE III
10968 The forest
10969 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES behind
10970 TOUCHSTONE Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats
10971 Audrey And how Audrey am I the man yet Doth my simple feature
10972 content you
10973 AUDREY Your features Lord warrant us What features
10974 TOUCHSTONE I am here with thee and thy goats as the most
10975 capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths
10976 JAQUES [Aside] O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove in a
10977 thatch'd house
10978 TOUCHSTONE When a man's verses cannot be understood nor a man's
10979 good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it
10980 strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room
10981 Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical
10982 AUDREY I do not know what 'poetical is Is it honest in deed and
10983 word Is it a true thing
10984 TOUCHSTONE No truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning
10985 and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may
10986 be said as lovers they do feign
10987 AUDREY Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
10988 TOUCHSTONE I do truly for thou swear'st to me thou art honest
10989 now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst
10990 feign
10991 AUDREY Would you not have me honest
10992 TOUCHSTONE No truly unless thou wert hardfavour'd for honesty
10993 coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
10994 JAQUES [Aside] A material fool
10995 AUDREY Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me
10996 honest
10997 TOUCHSTONE Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
10998 to put good meat into an unclean dish
10999 AUDREY I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul
11000 TOUCHSTONE Well praised be the gods for thy foulness
11001 sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will
11002 marry thee and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext
11003 the vicar of the next village who hath promis'd to meet me in
11004 this place of the forest and to couple us
11005 JAQUES [Aside] I would fain see this meeting
11006 AUDREY Well the gods give us joy
11007 TOUCHSTONE Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger
11008 in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no
11009 assembly but hornbeasts But what though Courage As horns are
11010 odious they are necessary It is said 'Many a man knows no end
11011 of his goods Right Many a man has good horns and knows no end
11012 of them Well that is the dowry of his wife 'tis none of his
11013 own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest
11014 deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore
11015 blessed No as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village so
11016 is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
11017 brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
11018 skill by so much is horn more precious than to want Here comes
11019 Sir Oliver
11020 Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
11021 Sir Oliver Martext you are well met Will you dispatch us here
11022 under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel
11023 MARTEXT Is there none here to give the woman
11024 TOUCHSTONE I will not take her on gift of any man
11025 MARTEXT Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
11026 JAQUES [Discovering himself] Proceed proceed I'll give her
11027 TOUCHSTONE Good even good Master Whatyecall't how do you sir
11028 You are very well met Goddild you for your last company I am
11029 very glad to see you Even a toy in hand here sir Nay pray be
11030 cover'd
11031 JAQUES Will you be married motley
11032 TOUCHSTONE As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
11033 the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons
11034 bill so wedlock would be nibbling
11035 JAQUES And will you being a man of your breeding be married
11036 under a bush like a beggar Get you to church and have a good
11037 priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but
11038 join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will
11039 prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
11040 TOUCHSTONE [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
11041 married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me
11042 well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me
11043 hereafter to leave my wife
11044 JAQUES Go thou with me and let me counsel thee
11045 TOUCHSTONE Come sweet Audrey
11046 We must be married or we must live in bawdry
11047 Farewell good Master Oliver Not
11048 O sweet Oliver
11049 O brave Oliver
11050 Leave me not behind thee
11051 But
11052 Wind away
11053 Begone I say
11054 I will not to wedding with thee
11055 Exeunt JAQUES TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
11056 MARTEXT 'Tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
11057 shall flout me out of my calling Exit
11058 SCENE IV
11059 The forest
11060 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
11061 ROSALIND Never talk to me I will weep
11062 CELIA Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears
11063 do not become a man
11064 ROSALIND But have I not cause to weep
11065 CELIA As good cause as one would desire therefore weep
11066 ROSALIND His very hair is of the dissembling colour
11067 CELIA Something browner than Judas's
11068 Marry his kisses are Judas's own children
11069 ROSALIND I faith his hair is of a good colour
11070 CELIA An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
11071 ROSALIND And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
11072 holy bread
11073 CELIA He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana A nun of
11074 winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of
11075 chastity is in them
11076 ROSALIND But why did he swear he would come this morning and
11077 comes not
11078 CELIA Nay certainly there is no truth in him
11079 ROSALIND Do you think so
11080 CELIA Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but
11081 for his verity in love I do think him as concave as covered
11082 goblet or a wormeaten nut
11083 ROSALIND Not true in love
11084 CELIA Yes when he is in but I think he is not in
11085 ROSALIND You have heard him swear downright he was
11086 CELIA 'Was is not 'is besides the oath of a lover is no
11087 stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer
11088 of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the Duke
11089 your father
11090 ROSALIND I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him
11091 He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as
11092 he so he laugh'd and let me go But what talk we of fathers when
11093 there is such a man as Orlando
11094 CELIA O that's a brave man He writes brave verses speaks brave
11095 words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite
11096 traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that
11097 spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
11098 goose But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides Who
11099 comes here
11100 Enter CORIN
11101 CORIN Mistress and master you have oft enquired
11102 After the shepherd that complain'd of love
11103 Who you saw sitting by me on the turf
11104 Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
11105 That was his mistress
11106 CELIA Well and what of him
11107 CORIN If you will see a pageant truly play'd
11108 Between the pale complexion of true love
11109 And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
11110 Go hence a little and I shall conduct you
11111 If you will mark it
11112 ROSALIND O come let us remove
11113 The sight of lovers feedeth those in love
11114 Bring us to this sight and you shall say
11115 I'll prove a busy actor in their play Exeunt
11116 SCENE V
11117 Another part of the forest
11118 Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
11119 SILVIUS Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe
11120 Say that you love me not but say not so
11121 In bitterness The common executioner
11122 Whose heart th accustom'd sight of death makes hard
11123 Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
11124 But first begs pardon Will you sterner be
11125 Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
11126 Enter ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN at a distance
11127 PHEBE I would not be thy executioner
11128 I fly thee for I would not injure thee
11129 Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye
11130 'Tis pretty sure and very probable
11131 That eyes that are the frail'st and softest things
11132 Who shut their coward gates on atomies
11133 Should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers
11134 Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
11135 And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
11136 Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
11137 Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
11138 Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
11139 Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
11140 Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
11141 Some scar of it lean upon a rush
11142 The cicatrice and capable impressure
11143 Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
11144 Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
11145 Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes
11146 That can do hurt
11147 SILVIUS O dear Phebe
11148 If ever as that ever may be near
11149 You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
11150 Then shall you know the wounds invisible
11151 That love's keen arrows make
11152 PHEBE But till that time
11153 Come not thou near me and when that time comes
11154 Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
11155 As till that time I shall not pity thee
11156 ROSALIND [Advancing] And why I pray you Who might be your
11157 mother
11158 That you insult exult and all at once
11159 Over the wretched What though you have no beauty
11160 As by my faith I see no more in you
11161 Than without candle may go dark to bed
11162 Must you be therefore proud and pitiless
11163 Why what means this Why do you look on me
11164 I see no more in you than in the ordinary
11165 Of nature's salework 'Od's my little life
11166 I think she means to tangle my eyes too
11167 No faith proud mistress hope not after it
11168 'Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
11169 Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
11170 That can entame my spirits to your worship
11171 You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
11172 Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
11173 You are a thousand times a properer man
11174 Than she a woman 'Tis such fools as you
11175 That makes the world full of illfavour'd children
11176 'Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
11177 And out of you she sees herself more proper
11178 Than any of her lineaments can show her
11179 But mistress know yourself Down on your knees
11180 And thank heaven fasting for a good man's love
11181 For I must tell you friendly in your ear
11182 Sell when you can you are not for all markets
11183 Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
11184 Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
11185 So take her to thee shepherd Fare you well
11186 PHEBE Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
11187 I had rather hear you chide than this man woo
11188 ROSALIND He's fall'n in love with your foulness and she'll fall
11189 in love with my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee
11190 with frowning looks I'll sauce her with bitter words Why look
11191 you so upon me
11192 PHEBE For no ill will I bear you
11193 ROSALIND I pray you do not fall in love with me
11194 For I am falser than vows made in wine
11195 Besides I like you not If you will know my house
11196 'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
11197 Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard
11198 Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
11199 And be not proud though all the world could see
11200 None could be so abus'd in sight as he
11201 Come to our flock Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN
11202 PHEBE Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might
11203 'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight'
11204 SILVIUS Sweet Phebe
11205 PHEBE Ha what say'st thou Silvius
11206 SILVIUS Sweet Phebe pity me
11207 PHEBE Why I arn sorry for thee gentle Silvius
11208 SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is relief would be
11209 If you do sorrow at my grief in love
11210 By giving love your sorrow and my grief
11211 Were both extermin'd
11212 PHEBE Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
11213 SILVIUS I would have you
11214 PHEBE Why that were covetousness
11215 Silvius the time was that I hated thee
11216 And yet it is not that I bear thee love
11217 But since that thou canst talk of love so well
11218 Thy company which erst was irksome to me
11219 I will endure and I'll employ thee too
11220 But do not look for further recompense
11221 Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd
11222 SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love
11223 And I in such a poverty of grace
11224 That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
11225 To glean the broken ears after the man
11226 That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
11227 A scatt'red smile and that I'll live upon
11228 PHEBE Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
11229 SILVIUS Not very well but I have met him oft
11230 And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
11231 That the old carlot once was master of
11232 PHEBE Think not I love him though I ask for him
11233 'Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
11234 But what care I for words Yet words do well
11235 When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
11236 It is a pretty youth not very pretty
11237 But sure he's proud and yet his pride becomes him
11238 He'll make a proper man The best thing in him
11239 Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
11240 Did make offence his eye did heal it up
11241 He is not very tall yet for his years he's tall
11242 His leg is but soso and yet 'tis well
11243 There was a pretty redness in his lip
11244 A little riper and more lusty red
11245 Than that mix'd in his cheek 'twas just the difference
11246 Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
11247 There be some women Silvius had they mark'd him
11248 In parcels as I did would have gone near
11249 To fall in love with him but for my part
11250 I love him not nor hate him not and yet
11251 I have more cause to hate him than to love him
11252 For what had he to do to chide at me
11253 He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
11254 And now I am rememb'red scorn'd at me
11255 I marvel why I answer'd not again
11256 But that's all one omittance is no quittance
11257 I'll write to him a very taunting letter
11258 And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius
11259 SILVIUS Phebe with all my heart
11260 PHEBE I'll write it straight
11261 The matter's in my head and in my heart
11262 I will be bitter with him and passing short
11263 Go with me Silvius Exeunt

11272 ACT IV SCENE I
11273 The forest
11274 Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES
11275 JAQUES I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with
11276 thee
11277 ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow
11278 JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing
11279 ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
11280 fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
11281 drunkards
11282 JAQUES Why 'tis good to be sad and say nothing
11283 ROSALIND Why then 'tis good to be a post
11284 JAQUES I have neither the scholar's melancholy which is
11285 emulation nor the musician's which is fantastical nor the
11286 courtier's which is proud nor the soldier's which is
11287 ambitious nor the lawyer's which is politic nor the lady's
11288 which is nice nor the lover's which is all these but it is a
11289 melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted
11290 from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my
11291 travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
11292 sadness
11293 ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be
11294 sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's then
11295 to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
11296 poor hands
11297 JAQUES Yes I have gain'd my experience
11298 Enter ORLANDO
11299 ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a
11300 fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to
11301 travel for it too
11302 ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind
11303 JAQUES Nay then God buy you an you talk in blank verse
11304 ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and wear
11305 strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be
11306 out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making
11307 you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have
11308 swam in a gondola [Exit JAQUES] Why how now Orlando where
11309 have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such
11310 another trick never come in my sight more
11311 ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise
11312 ROSALIND Break an hour's promise in love He that will divide a
11313 minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the
11314 thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said
11315 of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o th shoulder but I'll
11316 warrant him heartwhole
11317 ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind
11318 ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had
11319 as lief be woo'd of a snail
11320 ORLANDO Of a snail
11321 ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries
11322 his house on his head a better jointure I think than you make
11323 a woman besides he brings his destiny with him
11324 ORLANDO What's that
11325 ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to
11326 your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents
11327 the slander of his wife
11328 ORLANDO Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous
11329 ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind
11330 CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a
11331 better leer than you
11332 ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour
11333 and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I
11334 were your very very Rosalind
11335 ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke
11336 ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were
11337 gravell'd for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss
11338 Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for
11339 lovers lacking God warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to
11340 kiss
11341 ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied
11342 ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new
11343 matter
11344 ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress
11345 ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I
11346 should think my honesty ranker than my wit
11347 ORLANDO What of my suit
11348 ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
11349 Am not I your Rosalind
11350 ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking
11351 of her
11352 ROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you
11353 ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die
11354 ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six
11355 thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man
11356 died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause Troilus had
11357 his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
11358 could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love
11359 Leander he would have liv'd many a fair year though Hero had
11360 turn'd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for
11361 good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and
11362 being taken with the cramp was drown'd and the foolish
11363 chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos But these
11364 are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have
11365 eaten them but not for love
11366 ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I
11367 protest her frown might kill me
11368 ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I
11369 will be your Rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me
11370 what you will I will grant it
11371 ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind
11372 ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all
11373 ORLANDO And wilt thou have me
11374 ROSALIND Ay and twenty such
11375 ORLANDO What sayest thou
11376 ROSALIND Are you not good
11377 ORLANDO I hope so
11378 ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thing Come
11379 sister you shall be the priest and marry us Give me your hand
11380 Orlando What do you say sister
11381 ORLANDO Pray thee marry us
11382 CELIA I cannot say the words
11383 ROSALIND You must begin 'Will you Orlando'
11384 CELIA Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind
11385 ORLANDO I will
11386 ROSALIND Ay but when
11387 ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us
11388 ROSALIND Then you must say 'I take thee Rosalind for wife'
11389 ORLANDO I take thee Rosalind for wife
11390 ROSALIND I might ask you for your commission but I do take thee
11391 Orlando for my husband There's a girl goes before the priest
11392 and certainly a woman's thought runs before her actions
11393 ORLANDO So do all thoughts they are wing'd
11394 ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have
11395 possess'd her
11396 ORLANDO For ever and a day
11397 ROSALIND Say 'a day without the 'ever No no Orlando men are
11398 April when they woo December when they wed maids are May when
11399 they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will
11400 be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen
11401 more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than
11402 an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for
11403 nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you
11404 are dispos'd to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and that when
11405 thou are inclin'd to sleep
11406 ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so
11407 ROSALIND By my life she will do as I do
11408 ORLANDO O but she is wise
11409 ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser
11410 the waywarder Make the doors upon a woman's wit and it will out
11411 at the casement shut that and 'twill out at the keyhole stop
11412 that 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney
11413 ORLANDO A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say 'Wit
11414 whither wilt ROSALIND Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your
11415 wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed
11416 ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that
11417 ROSALIND Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never
11418 take her without her answer unless you take her without her
11419 tongue O that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
11420 occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will
11421 breed it like a fool
11422 ORLANDO For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee
11423 ROSALIND Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours
11424 ORLANDO I must attend the Duke at dinner by two o'clock I will be
11425 with thee again
11426 ROSALIND Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would
11427 prove my friends told me as much and I thought no less That
11428 flattering tongue of yours won me 'Tis but one cast away and
11429 so come death Two o'clock is your hour
11430 ORLANDO Ay sweet Rosalind
11431 ROSALIND By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and
11432 by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot
11433 of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will
11434 think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow
11435 lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may
11436 be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore
11437 beware my censure and keep your promise
11438 ORLANDO With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
11439 Rosalind so adieu
11440 ROSALIND Well Time is the old justice that examines all such
11441 offenders and let Time try Adieu Exit ORLANDO
11442 CELIA You have simply misus'd our sex in your loveprate We must
11443 have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head and show the
11444 world what the bird hath done to her own nest
11445 ROSALIND O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst
11446 know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded
11447 my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal
11448 CELIA Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection
11449 in it runs out
11450 ROSALIND No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of
11451 thought conceiv'd of spleen and born of madness that blind
11452 rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes because his own are
11453 out let him be judge how deep I am in love I'll tell thee
11454 Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando I'll go find a
11455 shadow and sigh till he come
11456 CELIA And I'll sleep Exeunt
11457 SCENE II
11458 The forest
11459 Enter JAQUES and LORDS in the habit of foresters
11460 JAQUES Which is he that killed the deer
11461 LORD Sir it was I
11462 JAQUES Let's present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror and
11463 it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
11464 branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose
11465 LORD Yes sir
11466 JAQUES Sing it 'tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise
11467 enough
11468 SONG
11469 What shall he have that kill'd the deer
11470 His leather skin and horns to wear
11471 [The rest shall hear this burden]
11472 Then sing him home
11473 Take thou no scorn to wear the horn
11474 It was a crest ere thou wast born
11475 Thy father's father wore it
11476 And thy father bore it
11477 The horn the horn the lusty horn
11478 Is not a thing to laugh to scorn Exeunt
11479 SCENE III
11480 The forest
11481 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
11482 ROSALIND How say you now Is it not past two o'clock
11483 And here much Orlando
11484 CELIA I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath
11485 ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep Look who
11486 comes here
11487 Enter SILVIUS
11488 SILVIUS My errand is to you fair youth
11489 My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this
11490 I know not the contents but as I guess
11491 By the stern brow and waspish action
11492 Which she did use as she was writing of it
11493 It bears an angry tenour Pardon me
11494 I am but as a guiltless messenger
11495 ROSALIND Patience herself would startle at this letter
11496 And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all
11497 She says I am not fair that I lack manners
11498 She calls me proud and that she could not love me
11499 Were man as rare as Phoenix 'Od's my will
11500 Her love is not the hare that I do hunt
11501 Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well
11502 This is a letter of your own device
11503 SILVIUS No I protest I know not the contents
11504 Phebe did write it
11505 ROSALIND Come come you are a fool
11506 And turn'd into the extremity of love
11507 I saw her hand she has a leathern hand
11508 A freestonecolour'd hand I verily did think
11509 That her old gloves were on but 'twas her hands
11510 She has a huswife's hand but that's no matter
11511 I say she never did invent this letter
11512 This is a man's invention and his hand
11513 SILVIUS Sure it is hers
11514 ROSALIND Why 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style
11515 A style for challengers Why she defies me
11516 Like Turk to Christian Women's gentle brain
11517 Could not drop forth such giantrude invention
11518 Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect
11519 Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter
11520 SILVIUS So please you for I never heard it yet
11521 Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty
11522 ROSALIND She Phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
11523 [Reads]
11524 'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd
11525 That a maiden's heart hath burn'd'
11526 Can a woman rail thus
11527 SILVIUS Call you this railing
11528 ROSALIND 'Why thy godhead laid apart
11529 Warr'st thou with a woman's heart'
11530 Did you ever hear such railing
11531 'Whiles the eye of man did woo me
11532 That could do no vengeance to me'
11533 Meaning me a beast
11534 'If the scorn of your bright eyne
11535 Have power to raise such love in mine
11536 Alack in me what strange effect
11537 Would they work in mild aspect
11538 Whiles you chid me I did love
11539 How then might your prayers move
11540 He that brings this love to the
11541 Little knows this love in me
11542 And by him seal up thy mind
11543 Whether that thy youth and kind
11544 Will the faithful offer take
11545 Of me and all that I can make
11546 Or else by him my love deny
11547 And then I'll study how to die'
11548 SILVIUS Call you this chiding
11549 CELIA Alas poor shepherd
11550 ROSALIND Do you pity him No he deserves no pity Wilt thou love
11551 such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false
11552 strains upon thee Not to be endur'd Well go your way to her
11553 for I see love hath made thee tame snake and say this to her
11554 that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not
11555 I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a
11556 true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company
11557 Exit SILVIUS
11558 Enter OLIVER
11559 OLIVER Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
11560 Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
11561 A sheepcote fenc'd about with olive trees
11562 CELIA West of this place down in the neighbour bottom
11563 The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
11564 Left on your right hand brings you to the place
11565 But at this hour the house doth keep itself
11566 There's none within
11567 OLIVER If that an eye may profit by a tongue
11568 Then should I know you by description
11569 Such garments and such years 'The boy is fair
11570 Of female favour and bestows himself
11571 Like a ripe sister the woman low
11572 And browner than her brother Are not you
11573 The owner of the house I did inquire for
11574 CELIA It is no boast being ask'd to say we are
11575 OLIVER Orlando doth commend him to you both
11576 And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
11577 He sends this bloody napkin Are you he
11578 ROSALIND I am What must we understand by this
11579 OLIVER Some of my shame if you will know of me
11580 What man I am and how and why and where
11581 This handkercher was stain'd
11582 CELIA I pray you tell it
11583 OLIVER When last the young Orlando parted from you
11584 He left a promise to return again
11585 Within an hour and pacing through the forest
11586 Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
11587 Lo what befell He threw his eye aside
11588 And mark what object did present itself
11589 Under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age
11590 And high top bald with dry antiquity
11591 A wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair
11592 Lay sleeping on his back About his neck
11593 A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself
11594 Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
11595 The opening of his mouth but suddenly
11596 Seeing Orlando it unlink'd itself
11597 And with indented glides did slip away
11598 Into a bush under which bush's shade
11599 A lioness with udders all drawn dry
11600 Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
11601 When that the sleeping man should stir for 'tis
11602 The royal disposition of that beast
11603 To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
11604 This seen Orlando did approach the man
11605 And found it was his brother his elder brother
11606 CELIA O I have heard him speak of that same brother
11607 And he did render him the most unnatural
11608 That liv'd amongst men
11609 OLIVER And well he might so do
11610 For well I know he was unnatural
11611 ROSALIND But to Orlando did he leave him there
11612 Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness
11613 OLIVER Twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so
11614 But kindness nobler ever than revenge
11615 And nature stronger than his just occasion
11616 Made him give battle to the lioness
11617 Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
11618 From miserable slumber I awak'd
11619 CELIA Are you his brother

11628 Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd
11629 As how I came into that desert place
11630 In brief he led me to the gentle Duke
11631 Who gave me fresh array and entertainment
11632 Committing me unto my brother's love
11633 Who led me instantly unto his cave
11634 There stripp'd himself and here upon his arm
11635 The lioness had torn some flesh away
11636 Which all this while had bled and now he fainted
11637 And cried in fainting upon Rosalind
11638 Brief I recover'd him bound up his wound
11639 And after some small space being strong at heart
11640 He sent me hither stranger as I am
11641 To tell this story that you might excuse
11642 His broken promise and to give this napkin
11643 Dy'd in his blood unto the shepherd youth
11644 That he in sport doth call his Rosalind
11645 [ROSALIND swoons]
11646 CELIA Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede

11656 this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how
11657 well I counterfeited Heighho
11658 OLIVER This was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in
11659 your complexion that it was a passion of earnest
11660 ROSALIND Counterfeit I assure you
11661 OLIVER Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
11662 ROSALIND So I do but i faith I should have been a woman by
11663 right

11773 they lov'd no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd no sooner sigh'd but
11774 they ask'd one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but

12093 EPILOGUE
12094 EPILOGUE
12095 ROSALIND It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but
12096 it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue If it
12097 be true that good wine needs no bush 'tis true that a good play
12098 needs no epilogue Yet to good wine they do use good bushes and
12099 good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues What a
12100 case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot
12101 insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play I am not
12102 furnish'd like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me My
12103 way is to conjure you and I'll begin with the women I charge
12104 you O women for the love you bear to men to like as much of
12105 this play as please you and I charge you O men for the love
12106 you bear to women as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
12107 hates them that between you and the women the play may please
12108 If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
12109 pleas'd me complexions that lik'd me and breaths that I defied
12110 not and I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces
12111 or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy
12112 bid me farewell

12153 THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
12154 ACT I SCENE 1
12155 A hall in the DUKE'S palace
12156 Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS AEGEON the Merchant
12157 of Syracuse GAOLER OFFICERS and other ATTENDANTS
12158 AEGEON Proceed Solinus to procure my fall
12159 And by the doom of death end woes and all
12160 DUKE Merchant of Syracuse plead no more
12161 I am not partial to infringe our laws
12162 The enmity and discord which of late
12163 Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
12164 To merchants our welldealing countrymen
12165 Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
12166 Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods
12167 Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks
12168 For since the mortal and intestine jars
12169 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
12170 It hath in solemn synods been decreed
12171 Both by the Syracusians and ourselves
12172 To admit no traffic to our adverse towns
12173 Nay more if any born at Ephesus
12174 Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs
12175 Again if any Syracusian born
12176 Come to the bay of Ephesushe dies
12177 His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose
12178 Unless a thousand marks be levied
12179 To quit the penalty and to ransom him
12180 Thy substance valued at the highest rate
12181 Cannot amount unto a hundred marks
12182 Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die
12183 AEGEON Yet this my comfort when your words are done
12184 My woes end likewise with the evening sun
12185 DUKE Well Syracusian say in brief the cause
12186 Why thou departed'st from thy native home
12187 And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus
12188 AEGEON A heavier task could not have been impos'd
12189 Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable
12190 Yet that the world may witness that my end
12191 Was wrought by nature not by vile offence
12192 I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
12193 In Syracuse was I born and wed
12194 Unto a woman happy but for me
12195 And by me had not our hap been bad
12196 With her I liv'd in joy our wealth increas'd
12197 By prosperous voyages I often made
12198 To Epidamnum till my factor's death
12199 And the great care of goods at random left
12200 Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
12201 From whom my absence was not six months old
12202 Before herself almost at fainting under
12203 The pleasing punishment that women bear
12204 Had made provision for her following me
12205 And soon and safe arrived where I was
12206 There had she not been long but she became
12207 A joyful mother of two goodly sons
12208 And which was strange the one so like the other
12209 As could not be disdnguish'd but by names
12210 That very hour and in the selfsame inn
12211 A mean woman was delivered
12212 Of such a burden male twins both alike
12213 Those for their parents were exceeding poor
12214 I bought and brought up to attend my sons
12215 My wife not meanly proud of two such boys
12216 Made daily motions for our home return
12217 Unwilling I agreed Alas too soon
12218 We came aboard
12219 A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
12220 Before the alwayswindobeying deep
12221 Gave any tragic instance of our harm
12222 But longer did we not retain much hope
12223 For what obscured light the heavens did grant
12224 Did but convey unto our fearful minds
12225 A doubtful warrant of immediate death
12226 Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd
12227 Yet the incessant weepings of my wife
12228 Weeping before for what she saw must come
12229 And piteous plainings of the pretty babes
12230 That mourn'd for fashion ignorant what to fear
12231 Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me
12232 And this it was for other means was none
12233 The sailors sought for safety by our boat
12234 And left the ship then sinkingripe to us
12235 My wife more careful for the latterborn
12236 Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast
12237 Such as seafaring men provide for storms
12238 To him one of the other twins was bound
12239 Whilst I had been like heedful of the other
12240 The children thus dispos'd my wife and I
12241 Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd
12242 Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast
12243 And floating straight obedient to the stream
12244 Was carried towards Corinth as we thought
12245 At length the sun gazing upon the earth
12246 Dispers'd those vapours that offended us
12247 And by the benefit of his wished light
12248 The seas wax'd calm and we discovered
12249 Two ships from far making amain to us
12250 Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this
12251 But ere they cameO let me say no more
12252 Gather the sequel by that went before
12253 DUKE Nay forward old man do not break off so
12254 For we may pity though not pardon thee
12255 AEGEON O had the gods done so I had not now
12256 Worthily term'd them merciless to us
12257 For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
12258 We were encount'red by a mighty rock
12259 Which being violently borne upon
12260 Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
12261 So that in this unjust divorce of us
12262 Fortune had left to both of us alike
12263 What to delight in what to sorrow for
12264 Her part poor soul seeming as burdened
12265 With lesser weight but not with lesser woe
12266 Was carried with more speed before the wind
12267 And in our sight they three were taken up
12268 By fishermen of Corinth as we thought
12269 At length another ship had seiz'd on us
12270 And knowing whom it was their hap to save
12271 Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests
12272 And would have reft the fishers of their prey
12273 Had not their bark been very slow of sail
12274 And therefore homeward did they bend their course
12275 Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss
12276 That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd
12277 To tell sad stories of my own mishaps
12278 DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
12279 Do me the favour to dilate at full
12280 What have befall'n of them and thee till now
12281 AEGEON My youngest boy and yet my eldest care
12282 At eighteen years became inquisitive
12283 After his brother and importun'd me
12284 That his attendantso his case was like
12285 Reft of his brother but retain'd his name
12286 Might bear him company in the quest of him
12287 Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see
12288 I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd
12289 Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece
12290 Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia
12291 And coasting homeward came to Ephesus
12292 Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
12293 Or that or any place that harbours men
12294 But here must end the story of my life
12295 And happy were I in my timely death
12296 Could all my travels warrant me they live
12297 DUKE Hapless Aegeon whom the fates have mark'd
12298 To bear the extremity of dire mishap
12299 Now trust me were it not against our laws
12300 Against my crown my oath my dignity
12301 Which princes would they may not disannul
12302 My soul should sue as advocate for thee
12303 But though thou art adjudged to the death
12304 And passed sentence may not be recall'd
12305 But to our honour's great disparagement
12306 Yet will I favour thee in what I can
12307 Therefore merchant I'll limit thee this day
12308 To seek thy help by beneficial hap
12309 Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus
12310 Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
12311 And live if no then thou art doom'd to die
12312 Gaoler take him to thy custody
12313 GAOLER I will my lord
12314 AEGEON Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend
12315 But to procrastinate his lifeless end
12316 <Exeunt

12354 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE He that commends me to mine own content
12355 Commends me to the thing I cannot get
12356 I to the world am like a drop of water

12420 The villain is o'erraught of all my money
12421 They say this town is full of cozenage
12422 As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
12423 Darkworking sorcerers that change the mind
12424 Soulkilling witches that deform the body
12425 Disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
12426 And many suchlike liberties of sin

12440 The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
12441 Enter ADRIANA wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with LUCIANA her sister
12442 ADRIANA Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
12443 That in such haste I sent to seek his master
12444 Sure Luciana it is two o'clock
12445 LUCIANA Perhaps some merchant hath invited him
12446 And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner
12447 Good sister let us dine and never fret
12448 A man is master of his liberty
12449 Time is their master and when they see time
12450 They'll go or come If so be patient sister
12451 ADRIANA Why should their liberty than ours be more
12452 LUCIANA Because their business still lies out o door
12453 ADRIANA Look when I serve him so he takes it ill
12454 LUCIANA O know he is the bridle of your will
12455 ADRIANA There's none but asses will be bridled so
12456 LUCIANA Why headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe
12457 There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
12458 But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
12459 The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
12460 Are their males subjects and at their controls
12461 Man more divine the master of all these
12462 Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas
12463 Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls
12464 Of more preeminence than fish and fowls
12465 Are masters to their females and their lords
12466 Then let your will attend on their accords
12467 ADRIANA This servitude makes you to keep unwed
12468 LUCIANA Not this but troubles of the marriagebed
12469 ADRIANA But were you wedded you would bear some sway
12470 LUCIANA Ere I learn love I'll practise to obey
12471 ADRIANA How if your husband start some other where
12472 LUCIANA Till he come home again I would forbear
12473 ADRIANA Patience unmov'd no marvel though she pause
12474 They can be meek that have no other cause
12475 A wretched soul bruis'd with adversity
12476 We bid be quiet when we hear it cry
12477 But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain
12478 As much or more we should ourselves complain
12479 So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
12480 With urging helpless patience would relieve me
12481 But if thou live to see like right bereft
12482 This foolbegg'd patience in thee will be left
12483 LUCIANA Well I will marry one day but to try
12484 Here comes your man now is your husband nigh
12485 Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
12486 ADRIANA Say is your tardy master now at hand

12488 ears can witness
12489 ADRIANA Say didst thou speak with him Know'st thou his mind
12490 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
12491 Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it
12492 LUCIANA Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning
12493 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay he struck so plainly I could to
12494 well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that I could
12495 scarce understand them
12496 ADRIANA But say I prithee is he coming home
12497 It seems he hath great care to please his wife
12498 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Why mistress sure my master is hornmad
12499 ADRIANA Hornmad thou villain
12500 DROMIO OF EPHESUS I mean not cuckoldmad
12501 But sure he is stark mad
12502 When I desir'd him to come home to dinner
12503 He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold
12504 Tis dinner time quoth I 'My gold quoth he
12505 'Your meat doth burn quoth I 'My gold quoth he
12506 'Will you come home quoth I 'My gold quoth he
12507 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee villain'
12508 'The pig quoth I 'is burn'd 'My gold quoth he
12509 'My mistress sir quoth I 'Hang up thy mistress
12510 I know not thy mistress out on thy mistress'
12511 LUCIANA Quoth who
12512 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Quoth my master
12513 'I know quoth he 'no house no wife no mistress'
12514 So that my errand due unto my tongue
12515 I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders
12516 For in conclusion he did beat me there
12517 ADRIANA Go back again thou slave and fetch him home
12518 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Go back again and be new beaten home
12519 For God's sake send some other messenger
12520 ADRIANA Back slave or I will break thy pate across
12521 DROMIO OF EPHESUS And he will bless that cross with other beating
12522 Between you I shall have a holy head
12523 ADRIANA Hence prating peasant Fetch thy master home
12524 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Am I so round with you as you with me
12525 That like a football you do spurn me thus
12526 You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
12527 If I last in this service you must case me in leather
12528 <Exit
12529 LUCIANA Fie how impatience loureth in your face
12530 ADRIANA His company must do his minions grace
12531 Whilst I at home starve for a merry look
12532 Hath homely age th alluring beauty took
12533 From my poor cheek Then he hath wasted it
12534 Are my discourses dull Barren my wit
12535 If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd
12536 Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
12537 Do their gay vestments his affections bait
12538 That's not my fault he's master of my state
12539 What ruins are in me that can be found
12540 By him not ruin'd Then is he the ground
12541 Of my defeatures My decayed fair
12542 A sunny look of his would soon repair
12543 But too unruly deer he breaks the pale
12544 And feeds from home poor I am but his stale
12545 LUCIANA Selfharming jealousy fie beat it hence
12546 ADRIANA Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
12547 I know his eye doth homage otherwhere
12548 Or else what lets it but he would be here
12549 Sister you know he promis'd me a chain
12550 Would that alone a love he would detain
12551 So he would keep fair quarter with his bed
12552 I see the jewel best enamelled
12553 Will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
12554 That others touch and often touching will
12555 Where gold and no man that hath a name
12556 By falsehood and corruption doth it shame
12557 Since that my beauty cannot please his eye
12558 I'll weep what's left away and weeping die
12559 LUCIANA How many fond fools serve mad jealousy
12560 <Exeunt
12561 SCENE 2
12562 The mart
12563 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
12564 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
12565 Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave
12566 Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out
12567 By computation and mine host's report
12568 I could not speak with Dromio since at first
12569 I sent him from the mart See here he comes
12570 Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
12571 How now sir is your merry humour alter'd
12572 As you love strokes so jest with me again
12573 You know no Centaur You receiv'd no gold
12574 Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
12575 My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad
12576 That thus so madly thou didst answer me
12577 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE What answer sir When spake I such a word
12578 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Even now even here not half an hour since
12579 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I did not see you since you sent me hence
12580 Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me
12581 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Villain thou didst deny the gold's receipt
12582 And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner
12583 For which I hope thou felt'st I was displeas'd
12584 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am glad to see you in this merry vein
12585 What means this jest I pray you master tell me
12586 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
12587 Think'st thou I jest Hold take thou that and that
12588 [Beating him]
12589 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Hold sir for God's sake Now your jest is earnest
12590 Upon what bargain do you give it me
12591 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Because that I familiarly sometimes
12592 Do use you for my fool and chat with you
12593 Your sauciness will jest upon my love
12594 And make a common of my serious hours
12595 When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
12596 But creep in crannies when he hides his beams
12597 If you will jest with me know my aspect
12598 And fashion your demeanour to my looks
12599 Or I will beat this method in your sconce
12600 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Sconce call you it So you would
12601 leave battering I had rather have it a head An you use
12602 these blows long I must get a sconce for my head and
12603 insconce it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders
12604 But I pray sir why am I beaten
12605 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Dost thou not know
12606 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nothing sir but that I am beaten
12607 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Shall I tell you why
12608 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Ay sir and wherefore for they say
12609 every why hath a wherefore
12610 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why first for flouting me and then wherefore
12611 For urging it the second time to me
12612 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
12613 When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason
12614 Well sir I thank you
12615 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thank me sir for what
12616 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir for this something that you gave
12617 me for nothing
12618 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I'll make you amends next to
12619 give you nothing for something But say sir is it dinnertime
12620 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No sir I think the meat wants that I have
12621 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE In good time sir what's that
12622 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Basting
12623 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Well sir then 'twill be dry
12624 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE If it be sir I pray you eat none of it
12625 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Your reason
12626 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Lest it make you choleric and purchase me
12627 another dry basting
12628 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Well sir learn to jest in good time
12629 there's a time for all things
12630 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I durst have denied that before you
12631 were so choleric
12632 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE By what rule sir
12633 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir by a rule as plain as the
12634 plain bald pate of Father Time himself
12635 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Let's hear it
12636 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE There's no time for a man to recover
12637 his hair that grows bald by nature
12638 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE May he not do it by fine and recovery
12639 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Yes to pay a fine for a periwig and
12640 recover the lost hair of another man
12641 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why is Time such a niggard of
12642 hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement
12643 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Because it is a blessing that he bestows
12644 on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
12645 given them in wit
12646 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why but there's many a man
12647 hath more hair than wit
12648 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not a man of those but he hath the
12649 wit to lose his hair
12650 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why thou didst conclude hairy
12651 men plain dealers without wit
12652 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The plainer dealer the sooner lost
12653 yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity
12654 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE For what reason
12655 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE For two and sound ones too
12656 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Nay not sound I pray you
12657 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Sure ones then
12658 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Nay not sure in a thing falsing
12659 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Certain ones then
12660 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Name them
12661 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The one to save the money that he spends in
12662 tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his
12663 porridge
12664 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE You would all this time have prov'd there
12665 is no time for all things
12666 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry and did sir namely no time to recover
12667 hair lost by nature
12668 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE But your reason was not substantial why
12669 there is no time to recover
12670 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Thus I mend it Time himself is bald
12671 and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers
12672 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion But
12673 soft who wafts us yonder
12674 Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
12675 ADRIANA Ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown
12676 Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
12677 I am not Adriana nor thy wife
12678 The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
12679 That never words were music to thine ear
12680 That never object pleasing in thine eye
12681 That never touch well welcome to thy hand
12682 That never meat sweetsavour'd in thy taste
12683 Unless I spake or look'd or touch'd or carv'd to thee
12684 How comes it now my husband O how comes it
12685 That thou art then estranged from thyself
12686 Thyself I call it being strange to me
12687 That undividable incorporate
12688 Am better than thy dear self's better part
12689 Ah do not tear away thyself from me
12690 For know my love as easy mayst thou fall
12691 A drop of water in the breaking gulf
12692 And take unmingled thence that drop again
12693 Without addition or diminishing
12694 As take from me thyself and not me too
12695 How dearly would it touch thee to the quick
12696 Should'st thou but hear I were licentious
12697 And that this body consecrate to thee
12698 By ruffian lust should be contaminate
12699 Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
12700 And hurl the name of husband in my face
12701 And tear the stain'd skin off my harlotbrow
12702 And from my false hand cut the weddingring
12703 And break it with a deepdivorcing vow
12704 I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
12705 I am possess'd with an adulterate blot
12706 My blood is mingled with the crime of lust
12707 For if we two be one and thou play false
12708 I do digest the poison of thy flesh
12709 Being strumpeted by thy contagion
12710 Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed
12711 I live disstain'd thou undishonoured
12712 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Plead you to me fair dame I know you not
12713 In Ephesus I am but two hours old
12714 As strange unto your town as to your talk
12715 Who every word by all my wit being scann'd
12716 Wants wit in all one word to understand
12717 LUCIANA Fie brother how the world is chang'd with you
12718 When were you wont to use my sister thus
12719 She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner
12720 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE By Dromio
12721 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE By me
12722 ADRIANA By thee and this thou didst return from him
12723 That he did buffet thee and in his blows
12724 Denied my house for his me for his wife
12725 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
12726 What is the course and drift of your compact
12727 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I Sir I never saw her till this time
12728 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Villain thou liest for even her very words
12729 Didst thou deliver to me on the mart
12730 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I never spake with her in all my life
12731 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How can she thus then call us by our names
12732 Unless it be by inspiration
12733 ADRIANA How ill agrees it with your gravity
12734 To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
12735 Abetting him to thwart me in my mood
12736 Be it my wrong you are from me exempt
12737 But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
12738 Come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine
12739 Thou art an elm my husband I a vine
12740 Whose weakness married to thy stronger state
12741 Makes me with thy strength to communicate
12742 If aught possess thee from me it is dross
12743 Usurping ivy brier or idle moss
12744 Who all for want of pruning with intrusion
12745 Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
12746 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE To me she speaks she moves me for her theme
12747 What was I married to her in my dream
12748 Or sleep I now and think I hear all this
12749 What error drives our eyes and ears amiss
12750 Until I know this sure uncertainty
12751 I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy
12752 LUCIANA Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
12753 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O for my beads I cross me for sinner
12754 This is the fairy land O spite of spites
12755 We talk with goblins owls and sprites
12756 If we obey them not this will ensue
12757 They'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
12758 LUCIANA Why prat'st thou to thyself and answer'st not
12759 Dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
12760 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am transformed master am not I
12761 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think thou art in mind and so am I
12762 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nay master both in mind and in my shape
12763 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou hast thine own form
12764 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No I am an ape
12765 LUCIANA If thou art chang'd to aught 'tis to an ass
12766 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 'Tis true she rides me and I long for grass
12767 'Tis so I am an ass else it could never be
12768 But I should know her as well as she knows me
12769 ADRIANA Come come no longer will I be a fool
12770 To put the finger in the eye and weep
12771 Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn
12772 Come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate
12773 Husband I'll dine above with you today
12774 And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
12775 Sirrah if any ask you for your master
12776 Say he dines forth and let no creature enter
12777 Come sister Dromio play the porter well
12778 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Am I in earth in heaven or in hell
12779 Sleeping or waking mad or welladvis'd
12780 Known unto these and to myself disguis'd
12781 I'll say as they say and persever so
12782 And in this mist at all adventures go
12783 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master shall I be porter at the gate
12784 ADRIANA Ay and let none enter lest I break your pate
12785 LUCIANA Come come Antipholus we dine too late

12797 Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS DROMIO OF EPHESUS ANGELO and BALTHAZAR
12798 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all
12799 My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
12800 Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
12801 To see the making of her carcanet
12802 And that tomorrow you will bring it home
12803 But here's a villain that would face me down
12804 He met me on the mart and that I beat him
12805 And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold
12806 And that I did deny my wife and house
12807 Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this
12808 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Say what you will sir but I know what I know
12809 That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show
12810 If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink
12811 Your own handwriting would tell you what I think
12812 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I think thou art an ass
12813 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Marry so it doth appear
12814 By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear
12815 I should kick being kick'd and being at that pass

12820 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS O Signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish
12821 A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish
12822 BALTHAZAR Good meat sir is common that every churl affords
12823 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And welcome more common for that's nothing
12824 but words
12825 BALTHAZAR Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast
12826 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest

12947 Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
12948 Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
12949 LUCIANA And may it be that you have quite forgot
12950 A husband's office Shall Antipholus
12951 Even in the spring of love thy lovesprings rot
12952 Shall love in building grow so ruinous
12953 If you did wed my sister for her wealth
12954 Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness
12955 Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
12956 Muffle your false love with some show of blindness
12957 Let not my sister read it in your eye
12958 Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator
12959 Look sweet speak fair become disloyalty
12960 Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger
12961 Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
12962 Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
12963 Be secretfalse What need she be acquainted
12964 What simple thief brags of his own attaint
12965 'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
12966 And let her read it in thy looks at board
12967 Shame hath a bastard fame well managed
12968 Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word
12969 Alas poor women make us but believe
12970 Being compact of credit that you love us
12971 Though others have the arm show us the sleeve
12972 We in your motion turn and you may move us
12973 Then gentle brother get you in again
12974 Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife

12976 When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
12977 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Sweet mistresswhat your name is else I know not
12978 Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine
12979 Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
12980 Than our earth's wondermore than earth divine
12981 Teach me dear creature how to think and speak
12982 Lay open to my earthygross conceit
12983 Smoth'red in errors feeble shallow weak
12984 The folded meaning of your words deceit
12985 Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
12986 To make it wander in an unknown field
12987 Are you a god Would you create me new
12988 Transform me then and to your pow'r I'll yield
12989 But if that I am I then well I know
12990 Your weeping sister is no wife of mine
12991 Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
12992 Far more far more to you do I decline
12993 O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
12994 To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears
12995 Sing siren for thyself and I will dote
12996 Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
12997 And as a bed I'll take them and there he
12998 And in that glorious supposition think
12999 He gains by death that hath such means to die

13038 lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not
13039 that I being a beast she would have me but that she
13040 being a very beastly creature lays claim to me
13041 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What is she
13042 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE A very reverent body ay such a one
13043 as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sirreverence'

13045 wondrous fat marriage
13046 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How dost thou mean a fat marriage
13047 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir she's the kitchenwench
13048 and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but
13049 to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light
13050 I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn
13051 Poland winter If she lives till doomsday she'll burn
13052 week longer than the whole world
13053 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What complexion is she of
13054 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Swart like my shoe but her face

13063 her from hip to hip
13064 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Then she bears some breadth
13065 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No longer from head to foot than
13066 from hip to hip she is spherical like a globe I could find
13067 out countries in her

13076 making war against her heir
13077 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where England
13078 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I look'd for the chalky cliffs but I
13079 could find no whiteness in them but I guess it stood in her
13080 chin by the salt rheum that ran between France and it
13081 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where Spain
13082 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in
13083 her breath
13084 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where America the Indies
13085 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O sir upon her nose an o'er embellished with
13086 rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the

13088 ballast at her nose
13089 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where stood Belgia the Netherlands
13090 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O Sir I did not look so low To
13091 conclude this drudge or diviner laid claim to me call'd me
13092 Dromio swore I was assur'd to her told me what privy
13093 marks I had about me as the mark of my shoulder the
13094 mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that I
13095 amaz'd ran from her as a witch
13096 And I think if my breast had not been made of faith
13097 and my heart of steel
13098 She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i th wheel
13099 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Go hie thee presently post to the road

13105 'Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone
13106 DROMIO OF SYRACUSE As from a bear a man would run for life
13107 So fly I from her that would be my wife
13108 <Exit
13109 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE There's none but witches do inhabit here
13110 And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence
13111 She that doth call me husband even my soul
13112 Doth for a wife abhor But her fair sister
13113 Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace
13114 Of such enchanting presence and discourse
13115 Hath almost made me traitor to myself
13116 But lest myself be guilty to selfwrong
13117 I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song

13404 they appear to men like angels of light light is an effect
13405 of fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn

13433 A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
13434 And for the same he promis'd me a chain
13435 Both one and other he denies me now
13436 The reason that I gather he is mad
13437 Besides this present instance of his rage
13438 Is a mad tale he told today at dinner
13439 Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
13440 Belike his wife acquainted with his fits
13441 On purpose shut the doors against his way
13442 My way is now to hie home to his house

13445 My ring away This course I fittest choose
13446 For forty ducats is too much to lose

13634 Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO
13635 ANGELO I am sorry sir that I have hind'red you
13636 But I protest he had the chain of me
13637 Though most dishonestly he doth deny it
13638 SECOND MERCHANT How is the man esteem'd here in the city
13639 ANGELO Of very reverend reputation sir
13640 Of credit infinite highly belov'd
13641 Second to none that lives here in the city

13646 Which he forswore most monstrously to have
13647 Good sir draw near to me I'll speak to him
13648 Signior Andpholus I wonder much
13649 That you would put me to this shame and trouble
13650 And not without some scandal to yourself
13651 With circumstance and oaths so to deny
13652 This chain which now you wear so openly
13653 Beside the charge the shame imprisonment
13654 You have done wrong to this my honest friend
13655 Who but for staying on our controversy
13656 Had hoisted sail and put to sea today
13657 This chain you had of me can you deny it
13658 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think I had I never did deny it
13659 SECOND MERCHANT Yes that you did sir and forswore it too
13660 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Who heard me to deny it or forswear it
13661 SECOND MERCHANT These ears of mine thou know'st did hear thee
13662 Fie on thee wretch 'tis pity that thou liv'st
13663 To walk where any honest men resort
13664 ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou art a villain to impeach me thus
13665 I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
13666 Against thee presently if thou dar'st stand
13667 SECOND MERCHANT I dare and do defy thee for a villain

13670 ADRIANA Hold hurt him not for God's sake He is mad
13671 Some get within him take his sword away
13672 Bind Dromio too and bear them to my house

13675 <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory
13676 Enter the LADY ABBESS
13677 ABBESS Be quiet people Wherefore throng you hither
13678 ADRIANA To fetch my poor distracted husband hence
13679 Let us come in that we may bind him fast
13680 And bear him home for his recovery
13681 ANGELO I knew he was not in his perfect wits
13682 SECOND MERCHANT I am sorry now that I did draw on him
13683 ABBESS How long hath this possession held the man
13684 ADRIANA This week he hath been heavy sour sad
13685 And much different from the man he was
13686 But till this afternoon his passion
13687 Ne'er brake into extremity of rage
13688 ABBESS Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
13689 Buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye
13690 Stray'd his affection in unlawful love
13691 A sin prevailing much in youthful men
13692 Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
13693 Which of these sorrows is he subject to
13694 ADRIANA To none of these except it be the last
13695 Namely some love that drew him oft from home
13696 ABBESS You should for that have reprehended him
13697 ADRIANA Why so I did
13698 ABBESS Ay but not rough enough
13699 ADRIANA As roughly as my modesty would let me
13700 ABBESS Haply in private
13701 ADRIANA And in assemblies too
13702 ABBESS Ay but not enough
13703 ADRIANA It was the copy of our conference
13704 In bed he slept not for my urging it
13705 At board he fed not for my urging it
13706 Alone it was the subject of my theme
13707 In company I often glanced it
13708 Still did I tell him it was vile and bad
13709 ABBESS And thereof came it that the man was mad
13710 The venom clamours of a jealous woman
13711 Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth
13712 It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing
13713 And thereof comes it that his head is light
13714 Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings
13715 Unquiet meals make ill digestions
13716 Thereof the raging fire of fever bred
13717 And what's a fever but a fit of madness
13718 Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls
13719 Sweet recreation barr'd what doth ensue
13720 But moody and dull melancholy
13721 Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
13722 And at her heels a huge infectious troop
13723 Of pale distemperatures and foes to life
13724 In food in sport and lifepreserving rest
13725 To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast
13726 The consequence is then thy jealous fits
13727 Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits
13728 LUCIANA She never reprehended him but mildly
13729 When he demean'd himself rough rude and wildly
13730 Why bear you these rebukes and answer not
13731 ADRIANA She did betray me to my own reproof
13732 Good people enter and lay hold on him
13733 ABBESS No not a creature enters in my house
13734 ADRIANA Then let your servants bring my husband forth
13735 ABBESS Neither he took this place for sanctuary
13736 And it shall privilege him from your hands
13737 Till I have brought him to his wits again
13738 Or lose my labour in assaying it
13739 ADRIANA I will attend my husband be his nurse
13740 Diet his sickness for it is my office
13741 And will have no attorney but myself
13742 And therefore let me have him home with me
13743 ABBESS Be patient for I will not let him stir
13744 Till I have us'd the approved means I have
13745 With wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
13746 To make of him a formal man again
13747 It is a branch and parcel of mine oath
13748 A charitable duty of my order
13749 Therefore depart and leave him here with me
13750 ADRIANA I will not hence and leave my husband here
13751 And ill it doth beseem your holiness
13752 To separate the husband and the wife
13753 ABBESS Be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
13754 <Exit
13755 LUCIANA Complain unto the Duke of this indignity
13756 ADRIANA Come go I will fall prostrate at his feet
13757 And never rise until my tears and prayers
13758 Have won his Grace to come in person hither
13759 And take perforce my husband from the Abbess
13760 SECOND MERCHANT By this I think the dial points at five
13761 Anon I'm sure the Duke himself in person
13762 Comes this way to the melancholy vale
13763 The place of death and sorry execution
13764 Behind the ditches of the abbey here
13765 ANGELO Upon what cause
13766 SECOND MERCHANT To see a reverend Syracusian merchant
13767 Who put unluckily into this bay
13768 Against the laws and statutes of this town
13769 Beheaded publicly for his offence
13770 ANGELO See where they come we will behold his death
13771 LUCIANA Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey
13772 Enter the DUKE attended AEGEON bareheaded
13773 with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS
13774 DUKE Yet once again proclaim it publicly
13775 If any friend will pay the sum for him
13776 He shall not die so much we tender him
13777 ADRIANA Justice most sacred Duke against the Abbess
13778 DUKE She is a virtuous and a reverend lady
13779 It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
13780 ADRIANA May it please your Grace Antipholus my husband
13781 Who I made lord of me and all I had
13782 At your important lettersthis ill day
13783 A most outrageous fit of madness took him
13784 That desp'rately he hurried through the street
13785 With him his bondman all as mad as he
13786 Doing displeasure to the citizens
13787 By rushing in their houses bearing thence
13788 Rings jewels anything his rage did like
13789 Once did I get him bound and sent him home
13790 Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
13791 That here and there his fury had committed
13792 Anon I wot not by what strong escape
13793 He broke from those that had the guard of him
13794 And with his mad attendant and himself
13795 Each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
13796 Met us again and madly bent on us
13797 Chas'd us away till raising of more aid
13798 We came again to bind them Then they fled
13799 Into this abbey whither we pursu'd them
13800 And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us
13801 And will not suffer us to fetch him out
13802 Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
13803 Therefore most gracious Duke with thy command
13804 Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
13805 DUKE Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars
13806 And I to thee engag'd a prince's word
13807 When thou didst make him master of thy bed
13808 To do him all the grace and good I could
13809 Go some of you knock at the abbey gate
13810 And bid the Lady Abbess come to me
13811 I will determine this before I stir
13812 Enter a MESSENGER
13813 MESSENGER O mistress mistress shift and save yourself
13814 My master and his man are both broke loose
13815 Beaten the maids arow and bound the doctor
13816 Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire
13817 And ever as it blaz'd they threw on him
13818 Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
13819 My master preaches patience to him and the while
13820 His man with scissors nicks him like a fool
13821 And sure unless you send some present help
13822 Between them they will kill the conjurer
13823 ADRIANA Peace fool thy master and his man are here
13824 And that is false thou dost report to us
13825 MESSENGER Mistress upon my life I tell you true
13826 I have not breath'd almost since I did see it

13845 She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife
13846 That hath abused and dishonoured me
13847 Even in the strength and height of injury
13848 Beyond imagination is the wrong
13849 That she this day hath shameless thrown on me
13850 DUKE Discover how and thou shalt find me just
13851 ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS This day great Duke she shut the doors upon me
13852 While she with harlots feasted in my house
13853 DUKE A grievous fault Say woman didst thou so
13854 ADRIANA No my good lord Myself he and my sister
13855 Today did dine together So befall my soul
13856 As this is false he burdens me withal
13857 LUCIANA Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
13858 But she tells to your Highness simple truth
13859 ANGELO O peflur'd woman They are both forsworn
13860 In this the madman justly chargeth them
13861 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS My liege I am advised what I say
13862 Neither disturbed with the effect of wine
13863 Nor headyrash provok'd with raging ire
13864 Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
13865 This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner
13866 That goldsmith there were he not pack'd with her
13867 Could witness it for he was with me then
13868 Who parted with me to go fetch a chain
13869 Promising to bring it to the Porpentine
13870 Where Balthazar and I did dine together
13871 Our dinner done and he not coming thither
13872 I went to seek him In the street I met him
13873 And in his company that gentleman
13874 There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
13875 That I this day of him receiv'd the chain
13876 Which God he knows I saw not for the which
13877 He did arrest me with an officer
13878 I did obey and sent my peasant home
13879 For certain ducats he with none return'd
13880 Then fairly I bespoke the officer
13881 To go in person with me to my house
13882 By th way we met my wife her sister and a rabble more
13883 Of vile confederates Along with them
13884 They brought one Pinch a hungry leanfac'd villain
13885 A mere anatomy a mountebank
13886 A threadbare juggler and a fortuneteller
13887 A needy hollowey'd sharplooking wretch
13888 A living dead man This pernicious slave
13889 Forsooth took on him as a conjurer
13890 And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
13891 And with no face as 'twere outfacing me
13892 Cries out I was possess'd Then all together
13893 They fell upon me bound me bore me thence
13894 And in a dark and dankish vault at home
13895 There left me and my man both bound together
13896 Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
13897 I gain'd my freedom and immediately
13898 Ran hither to your Grace whom I beseech
13899 To give me ample satisfaction
13900 For these deep shames and great indignities
13901 ANGELO My lord in truth thus far I witness with him
13902 That he din'd not at home but was lock'd out
13903 DUKE But had he such a chain of thee or no
13904 ANGELO He had my lord and when he ran in here
13905 These people saw the chain about his neck
13906 SECOND MERCHANT Besides I will be sworn these ears of mine
13907 Heard you confess you had the chain of him
13908 After you first forswore it on the mart
13909 And thereupon I drew my sword on you
13910 And then you fled into this abbey here
13911 From whence I think you are come by miracle
13912 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never came within these abbey walls
13913 Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
13914 I never saw the chain so help me Heaven
13915 And this is false you burden me withal
13916 DUKE Why what an intricate impeach is this
13917 I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup
13918 If here you hous'd him here he would have been
13919 If he were mad he would not plead so coldly
13920 You say he din'd at home the goldsmith here
13921 Denies that saying Sirrah what say you
13922 DROMIO OF EPHESUS Sir he din'd with her there at the Porpentine
13923 COURTEZAN He did and from my finger snatch'd that ring
13924 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS 'Tis true my liege this ring I had of her
13925 DUKE Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here
13926 COURTEZAN As sure my liege as I do see your Grace
13927 DUKE Why this is strange Go call the Abbess hither
13928 I think you are all mated or stark mad

13934 AEGEON Is not your name sir call'd Antipholus
13935 And is not that your bondman Dromio

13937 But he I thank him gnaw'd in two my cords
13938 Now am I Dromio and his man unbound
13939 AEGEON I am sure you both of you remember me

13948 But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
13949 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Neither
13950 AEGEON Dromio nor thou
13951 DROMIO OF EPHESUS No trust me sir nor I

13956 Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
13957 In seven short years that here my only son
13958 Knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares
13959 Though now this grained face of mine be hid
13960 In sapconsuming winter's drizzled snow
13961 And all the conduits of my blood froze up
13962 Yet hath my night of life some memory
13963 My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
13964 My dull deaf ears a little use to hear
13965 All these old witnessesI cannot err
13966 Tell me thou art my son Antipholus
13967 ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw my father in my life
13968 AEGEON But seven years since in Syracuse boy

13994 O if thou be'st the same Aegeon speak
13995 And speak unto the same Aemilia
13996 AEGEON If I dream not thou art Aemilia

13998 That floated with thee on the fatal raft
13999 ABBESS By men of Epidamnum he and I
14000 And the twin Dromio all were taken up
14001 But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth

14133 FIRST CITIZEN Before we proceed any further hear me speak
14134 ALL Speak speak
14135 FIRST CITIZEN YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish
14136 ALL Resolv'd resolv'd

14138 people
14139 ALL We know't we know't

14141 price Is't a verdict
14142 ALL No more talking on't let it be done Away away
14143 SECOND CITIZEN One word good citizens
14144 FIRST CITIZEN We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
14145 What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield
14146 us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess
14147 they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear The
14148 leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
14149 inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a
14150 gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
14151 rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in
14152 thirst for revenge
14153 SECOND CITIZEN Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius
14154 FIRST CITIZEN Against him first he's a very dog to the
14155 commonalty
14156 SECOND CITIZEN Consider you what services he has done for his
14157 country
14158 FIRST CITIZEN Very well and could be content to give him good
14159 report for't but that he pays himself with being proud
14160 SECOND CITIZEN Nay but speak not maliciously
14161 FIRST CITIZEN I say unto you what he hath done famously he did it
14162 to that end though softconscienc'd men can be content to say it
14163 was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be
14164 partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue
14165 SECOND CITIZEN What he cannot help in his nature you account a
14166 vice in him You must in no way say he is covetous
14167 FIRST CITIZEN If I must not I need not be barren of accusations
14168 he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition [Shouts
14169 within] What shouts are these The other side o th city is
14170 risen Why stay we prating here To th Capitol
14171 ALL Come come

14180 had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we'll
14181 show 'em in deeds They say poor suitors have strong breaths
14182 they shall know we have strong arms too
14183 MENENIUS Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
14184 Will you undo yourselves
14185 FIRST CITIZEN We cannot sir we are undone already
14186 MENENIUS I tell you friends most charitable care
14187 Have the patricians of you For your wants
14188 Your suffering in this dearth you may as well
14189 Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
14190 Against the Roman state whose course will on
14191 The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
14192 Of more strong link asunder than can ever
14193 Appear in your impediment For the dearth
14194 The gods not the patricians make it and
14195 Your knees to them not arms must help Alack
14196 You are transported by calamity
14197 Thither where more attends you and you slander
14198 The helms o th state who care for you like fathers
14199 When you curse them as enemies
14200 FIRST CITIZEN Care for us True indeed They ne'er car'd for us
14201 yet Suffer us to famish and their storehouses cramm'd with
14202 grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily
14203 any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more
14204 piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor If the
14205 wars eat us not up they will and there's all the love they bear
14206 us
14207 MENENIUS Either you must
14208 Confess yourselves wondrous malicious
14209 Or be accus'd of folly I shall tell you
14210 A pretty tale It may be you have heard it
14211 But since it serves my purpose I will venture
14212 To stale't a little more
14213 FIRST CITIZEN Well I'll hear it sir yet you must not think to
14214 fob off our disgrace with a tale But an't please you deliver
14215 MENENIUS There was a time when all the body's members
14216 Rebell'd against the belly thus accus'd it
14217 That only like a gulf it did remain
14218 I th midst o th body idle and unactive
14219 Still cupboarding the viand never bearing
14220 Like labour with the rest where th other instruments
14221 Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
14222 And mutually participate did minister
14223 Unto the appetite and affection common
14224 Of the whole body The belly answer'd
14225 FIRST CITIZEN Well sir what answer made the belly
14226 MENENIUS Sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile
14227 Which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus
14228 For look you I may make the belly smile
14229 As well as speak it tauntingly replied
14230 To th discontented members the mutinous parts
14231 That envied his receipt even so most fitly
14232 As you malign our senators for that
14233 They are not such as you
14234 FIRST CITIZEN Your belly's answer What
14235 The kingly crowned head the vigilant eye
14236 The counsellor heart the arm our soldier
14237 Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
14238 With other muniments and petty helps
14239 Is this our fabric if that they

14241 Fore me this fellow speaks What then What then
14242 FIRST CITIZEN Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd
14243 Who is the sink o th body
14244 MENENIUS Well what then
14245 FIRST CITIZEN The former agents if they did complain
14246 What could the belly answer
14247 MENENIUS I will tell you
14248 If you'll bestow a small of what you have little
14249 Patience awhile you'st hear the belly's answer
14250 FIRST CITIZEN Y'are long about it
14251 MENENIUS Note me this good friend
14252 Your most grave belly was deliberate
14253 Not rash like his accusers and thus answered
14254 'True is it my incorporate friends quoth he
14255 'That I receive the general food at first
14256 Which you do live upon and fit it is
14257 Because I am the storehouse and the shop
14258 Of the whole body But if you do remember
14259 I send it through the rivers of your blood
14260 Even to the court the heart to th seat o th brain
14261 And through the cranks and offices of man
14262 The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
14263 From me receive that natural competency
14264 Whereby they live And though that all at once
14265 You my good friends this says the belly mark me
14266 FIRST CITIZEN Ay sir well well

14270 From me do back receive the flour of all
14271 And leave me but the bran What say you to t
14272 FIRST CITIZEN It was an answer How apply you this
14273 MENENIUS The senators of Rome are this good belly
14274 And you the mutinous members for examine
14275 Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
14276 Touching the weal o th common you shall find
14277 No public benefit which you receive
14278 But it proceeds or comes from them to you
14279 And no way from yourselves What do you think
14280 You the great toe of this assembly
14281 FIRST CITIZEN I the great toe Why the great toe
14282 MENENIUS For that being one o th lowest basest poorest
14283 Of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost
14284 Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
14285 Lead'st first to win some vantage
14286 But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
14287 Rome and her rats are at the point of battle
14288 The one side must have bale
14289 Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
14290 Hail noble Marcius
14291 MARCIUS Thanks What's the matter you dissentious rogues
14292 That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
14293 Make yourselves scabs
14294 FIRST CITIZEN We have ever your good word
14295 MARCIUS He that will give good words to thee will flatter
14296 Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs
14297 That like nor peace nor war The one affrights you
14298 The other makes you proud He that trusts to you
14299 Where he should find you lions finds you hares
14300 Where foxes geese you are no surer no
14301 Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
14302 Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is
14303 To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
14304 And curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness
14305 Deserves your hate and your affections are
14306 A sick man's appetite who desires most that
14307 Which would increase his evil He that depends
14308 Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
14309 And hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust ye
14310 With every minute you do change a mind
14311 And call him noble that was now your hate
14312 Him vile that was your garland What's the matter
14313 That in these several places of the city
14314 You cry against the noble Senate who
14315 Under the gods keep you in awe which else
14316 Would feed on one another What's their seeking
14317 MENENIUS For corn at their own rates whereof they say
14318 The city is well stor'd
14319 MARCIUS Hang 'em They say
14320 They'll sit by th fire and presume to know
14321 What's done i th Capitol who's like to rise
14322 Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out
14323 Conjectural marriages making parties strong
14324 And feebling such as stand not in their liking
14325 Below their cobbled shoes They say there's grain enough
14326 Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
14327 And let me use my sword I'd make a quarry
14328 With thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high
14329 As I could pick my lance
14330 MENENIUS Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
14331 For though abundantly they lack discretion
14332 Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you
14333 What says the other troop
14334 MARCIUS They are dissolv'd Hang 'em
14335 They said they were anhungry sigh'd forth proverbs
14336 That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
14337 That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
14338 Corn for the rich men only With these shreds
14339 They vented their complainings which being answer'd
14340 And a petition granted them a strange one
14341 To break the heart of generosity
14342 And make bold power look pale they threw their caps
14343 As they would hang them on the horns o th moon
14344 Shouting their emulation
14345 MENENIUS What is granted them
14346 MARCIUS Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
14347 Of their own choice One's Junius Brutus
14348 Sicinius Velutus and I know not 'Sdeath
14349 The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
14350 Ere so prevail'd with me it will in time
14351 Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
14352 For insurrection's arguing
14353 MENENIUS This is strange
14354 MARCIUS Go get you home you fragments
14355 Enter a MESSENGER hastily
14356 MESSENGER Where's Caius Marcius
14357 MARCIUS Here What's the matter
14358 MESSENGER The news is sir the Volsces are in arms
14359 MARCIUS I am glad on't then we shall ha means to vent
14360 Our musty superfluity See our best elders
14361 Enter COMINIUS TITUS LARTIUS with other SENATORS
14362 JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
14363 FIRST SENATOR Marcius 'tis true that you have lately told us
14364 The Volsces are in arms
14365 MARCIUS They have a leader
14366 Tullus Aufidius that will put you to't
14367 I sin in envying his nobility
14368 And were I anything but what I am
14369 I would wish me only he
14370 COMINIUS You have fought together
14371 MARCIUS Were half to half the world by th ears and he
14372 Upon my party I'd revolt to make
14373 Only my wars with him He is a lion
14374 That I am proud to hunt
14375 FIRST SENATOR Then worthy Marcius
14376 Attend upon Cominius to these wars
14377 COMINIUS It is your former promise
14378 MARCIUS Sir it is
14379 And I am constant Titus Lartius thou
14380 Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus face
14381 What art thou stiff Stand'st out
14382 LARTIUS No Caius Marcius
14383 I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
14384 Ere stay behind this business
14385 MENENIUS O true bred
14386 FIRST SENATOR Your company to th Capitol where I know
14387 Our greatest friends attend us
14388 LARTIUS [To COMINIUS] Lead you on
14389 [To MARCIUS] Follow Cominius we must follow you
14390 Right worthy you priority
14391 COMINIUS Noble Marcius
14392 FIRST SENATOR [To the Citizens] Hence to your homes be gone
14393 MARCIUS Nay let them follow
14394 The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither
14395 To gnaw their garners Worshipful mutineers
14396 Your valour puts well forth pray follow
14397 Ciitzens steal away Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
14398 SICINIUS Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius
14399 BRUTUS He has no equal
14400 SICINIUS When we were chosen tribunes for the people
14401 BRUTUS Mark'd you his lip and eyes
14402 SICINIUS Nay but his taunts
14403 BRUTUS Being mov'd he will not spare to gird the gods
14404 SICINIUS Bemock the modest moon
14405 BRUTUS The present wars devour him He is grown
14406 Too proud to be so valiant
14407 SICINIUS Such a nature
14408 Tickled with good success disdains the shadow
14409 Which he treads on at noon But I do wonder
14410 His insolence can brook to be commanded
14411 Under Cominius
14412 BRUTUS Fame at the which he aims
14413 In whom already he is well grac'd cannot
14414 Better be held nor more attain'd than by
14415 A place below the first for what miscarries
14416 Shall be the general's fault though he perform
14417 To th utmost of a man and giddy censure
14418 Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
14419 Had borne the business'
14420 SICINIUS Besides if things go well
14421 Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
14422 Of his demerits rob Cominius
14423 BRUTUS Come
14424 Half all Cominius honours are to Marcius
14425 Though Marcius earn'd them not and all his faults
14426 To Marcius shall be honours though indeed
14427 In aught he merit not
14428 SICINIUS Let's hence and hear
14429 How the dispatch is made and in what fashion
14430 More than his singularity he goes
14431 Upon this present action
14432 BRUTUS Let's along Exeunt
14433 SCENE II

14435 Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli
14436 FIRST SENATOR So your opinion is Aufidius
14437 That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels
14438 And know how we proceed
14439 AUFIDIUS Is it not yours
14440 What ever have been thought on in this state
14441 That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
14442 Had circumvention 'Tis not four days gone
14443 Since I heard thence these are the words I think
14444 I have the letter hereyes here it is
14445 [Reads] 'They have press'd a power but it is not known
14446 Whether for east or west The dearth is great
14447 The people mutinous and it is rumour'd
14448 Cominius Marcius your old enemy
14449 Who is of Rome worse hated than of you
14450 And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman
14451 These three lead on this preparation
14452 Whither 'tis bent Most likely 'tis for you
14453 Consider of it'
14454 FIRST SENATOR Our army's in the field
14455 We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
14456 To answer us
14457 AUFIDIUS Nor did you think it folly
14458 To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
14459 They needs must show themselves which in the hatching
14460 It seem'd appear'd to Rome By the discovery
14461 We shall be short'ned in our aim which was
14462 To take in many towns ere almost Rome
14463 Should know we were afoot
14464 SECOND SENATOR Noble Aufidius
14465 Take your commission hie you to your bands
14466 Let us alone to guard Corioli
14467 If they set down before's for the remove
14468 Bring up your army but I think you'll find
14469 Th have not prepar'd for us
14470 AUFIDIUS O doubt not that
14471 I speak from certainties Nay more
14472 Some parcels of their power are forth already
14473 And only hitherward I leave your honours
14474 If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet
14475 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
14476 Till one can do no more

14485 they set them down on two low stools and sew
14486 VOLUMNIA I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more
14487 comfortable sort If my son were my husband I should freelier
14488 rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
14489 embracements of his bed where he would show most love When yet
14490 he was but tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when youth
14491 with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way when for a day of
14492 kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her
14493 beholding I considering how honour would become such a person
14494 that it was no better than picturelike to hang by th wall if
14495 renown made it not stir was pleas'd to let him seek danger where
14496 he was to find fame To a cruel war I sent him from whence he
14497 return'd his brows bound with oak I tell thee daughter I
14498 sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild than
14499 now in first seeing he had proved himself a man
14500 VIRGILIA But had he died in the business madam how then
14501 VOLUMNIA Then his good report should have been my son I therein
14502 would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen
14503 sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my
14504 good Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
14505 than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
14506 Enter a GENTLEWOMAN
14507 GENTLEWOMAN Madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you
14508 VIRGILIA Beseech you give me leave to retire myself
14509 VOLUMNIA Indeed you shall not
14510 Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum
14511 See him pluck Aufidius down by th hair
14512 As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him
14513 Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus
14514 'Come on you cowards You were got in fear
14515 Though you were born in Rome His bloody brow
14516 With his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes
14517 Like to a harvestman that's task'd to mow
14518 Or all or lose his hire
14519 VIRGILIA His bloody brow O Jupiter no blood
14520 VOLUMNIA Away you fool It more becomes a man
14521 Than gilt his trophy The breasts of Hecuba
14522 When she did suckle Hector look'd not lovelier
14523 Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
14524 At Grecian sword contemning Tell Valeria
14525 We are fit to bid her welcome Exit GENTLEWOMAN
14526 VIRGILIA Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius
14527 VOLUMNIA He'll beat Aufidius head below his knee

14535 son
14536 VIRGILIA I thank your ladyship well good madam

14539 VALERIA O my word the father's son I'll swear 'tis a very
14540 pretty boy O my troth I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an
14541 hour together has such a confirm'd countenance I saw him run
14542 after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go
14543 again and after it again and over and over he comes and up
14544 again catch'd it again or whether his fall enrag'd him or how
14545 'twas he did so set his teeth and tear it O I warrant how he
14546 mammock'd it
14547 VOLUMNIA One on's father's moods
14548 VALERIA Indeed la 'tis a noble child

14564 she spun in Ulysses absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths
14565 Come I would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you
14566 might leave pricking it for pity Come you shall go with us
14567 VIRGILIA No good madam pardon me indeed I will not forth
14568 VALERIA In truth la go with me and I'll tell you excellent news
14569 of your husband
14570 VIRGILIA O good madam there can be none yet

14614 That's lesser than a little [Drum afar off] Hark our drums
14615 Are bringing forth our youth We'll break our walls
14616 Rather than they shall pound us up our gates
14617 Which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes
14618 They'll open of themselves [Alarum far off] Hark you far off
14619 There is Aufidius List what work he makes

14625 Now put your shields before your hearts and fight
14626 With hearts more proof than shields Advance brave Titus
14627 They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
14628 Which makes me sweat with wrath Come on my fellows

14639 From slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell
14640 All hurt behind Backs red and faces pale
14641 With flight and agued fear Mend and charge home
14642 Or by the fires of heaven I'll leave the foe
14643 And make my wars on you Look to't Come on

14663 LARTIUS O noble fellow
14664 Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
14665 And when it bows stand'st up Thou art left Marcius
14666 A carbuncle entire as big as thou art
14667 Were not so rich a jewel Thou wast a soldier
14668 Even to Cato's wish not fierce and terrible
14669 Only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
14670 The thunderlike percussion of thy sounds
14671 Thou mad'st thine enemies shake as if the world
14672 Were feverous and did tremble
14673 Reenter MARCIUS bleeding assaulted by the enemy
14674 FIRST SOLDIER Look sir

14696 Whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste
14697 To help Cominius
14698 LARTIUS Worthy sir thou bleed'st
14699 Thy exercise hath been too violent
14700 For a second course of fight
14701 MARCIUS Sir praise me not
14702 My work hath yet not warm'd me Fare you well
14703 The blood I drop is rather physical
14704 Than dangerous to me To Aufidius thus
14705 I will appear and fight
14706 LARTIUS Now the fair goddess Fortune
14707 Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
14708 Misguide thy opposers swords Bold gentleman

14748 Beforetime seen him thus
14749 MARCIUS Come I too late
14750 COMINIUS The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
14751 More than I know the sound of Marcius tongue
14752 From every meaner man
14753 MARCIUS Come I too late
14754 COMINIUS Ay if you come not in the blood of others
14755 But mantled in your own
14756 MARCIUS O let me clip ye
14757 In arms as sound as when I woo'd in heart
14758 As merry as when our nuptial day was done
14759 And tapers burn'd to bedward
14760 COMINIUS Flower of warriors
14761 How is't with Titus Lartius
14762 MARCIUS As with a man busied about decrees
14763 Condemning some to death and some to exile
14764 Ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th other
14765 Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
14766 Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
14767 To let him slip at will
14768 COMINIUS Where is that slave
14769 Which told me they had beat you to your trenches
14770 Where is he Call him hither
14771 MARCIUS Let him alone
14772 He did inform the truth But for our gentlemen
14773 The common file a plague tribunes for them
14774 The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
14775 From rascals worse than they
14776 COMINIUS But how prevail'd you
14777 MARCIUS Will the time serve to tell I do not think
14778 Where is the enemy Are you lords o th field
14779 If not why cease you till you are so
14780 COMINIUS Marcius
14781 We have at disadvantage fought and did
14782 Retire to win our purpose
14783 MARCIUS How lies their battle Know you on which side
14784 They have plac'd their men of trust
14785 COMINIUS As I guess Marcius
14786 Their bands i th vaward are the Antiates
14787 Of their best trust o'er them Aufidius
14788 Their very heart of hope
14789 MARCIUS I do beseech you
14790 By all the battles wherein we have fought
14791 By th blood we have shed together by th vows
14792 We have made to endure friends that you directly
14793 Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates
14794 And that you not delay the present but
14795 Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts
14796 We prove this very hour
14797 COMINIUS Though I could wish
14798 You were conducted to a gentle bath
14799 And balms applied to you yet dare I never
14800 Deny your asking take your choice of those
14801 That best can aid your action
14802 MARCIUS Those are they
14803 That most are willing If any such be here
14804 As it were sin to doubt that love this painting
14805 Wherein you see me smear'd if any fear
14806 Lesser his person than an ill report
14807 If any think brave death outweighs bad life
14808 And that his country's dearer than himself
14809 Let him alone or so many so minded
14810 Wave thus to express his disposition
14811 And follow Marcius [They all shout and wave their
14812 swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps]
14813 O me alone Make you a sword of me
14814 If these shows be not outward which of you
14815 But is four Volsces None of you but is
14816 Able to bear against the great Aufidius
14817 A shield as hard as his A certain number
14818 Though thanks to all must I select from all the rest
14819 Shall bear the business in some other fight
14820 As cause will be obey'd Please you to march
14821 And four shall quickly draw out my command
14822 Which men are best inclin'd
14823 COMINIUS March on my fellows
14824 Make good this ostentation and you shall
14825 Divide in all with us Exeunt
14826 SCENE VII

14828 TITUS LARTIUS having set a guard upon Corioli going with drum and trumpet

14831 LARTIUS So let the ports be guarded keep your duties
14832 As I have set them down If I do send dispatch
14833 Those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
14834 For a short holding If we lose the field
14835 We cannot keep the town

14840 A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
14841 Alarum as in battle Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several doors
14842 MARCIUS I'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee
14843 Worse than a promisebreaker
14844 AUFIDIUS We hate alike
14845 Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
14846 More than thy fame and envy Fix thy foot
14847 MARCIUS Let the first budger die the other's slave
14848 And the gods doom him after
14849 AUFIDIUS If I fly Marcius
14850 Halloa me like a hare
14851 MARCIUS Within these three hours Tullus
14852 Alone I fought in your Corioli walls
14853 And made what work I pleas'd 'Tis not my blood
14854 Wherein thou seest me mask'd For thy revenge
14855 Wrench up thy power to th highest
14856 AUFIDIUS Wert thou the Hector
14857 That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny
14858 Thou shouldst not scape me here
14859 Here they fight and certain Volsces come in the aid
14860 of AUFIDIUS MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
14861 breathless
14862 Officious and not valiant you have sham'd me

14866 Flourish Alarum A retreat is sounded Enter at one door
14867 COMINIUS with the Romans at another door MARCIUS with his arm in a scarf
14868 COMINIUS If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work
14869 Thou't not believe thy deeds but I'll report it
14870 Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
14871 Where great patricians shall attend and shrug
14872 I th end admire where ladies shall be frighted
14873 And gladly quak'd hear more where the dull tribunes
14874 That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
14875 Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
14876 Our Rome hath such a soldier'
14877 Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast
14878 Having fully din'd before
14879 Enter TITUS LARTIUS with his power from the pursuit
14880 LARTIUS O General
14881 Here is the steed we the caparison
14882 Hadst thou beheld
14883 MARCIUS Pray now no more my mother
14884 Who has a charter to extol her blood
14885 When she does praise me grieves me I have done
14886 As you have done that's what I can induc'd
14887 As you have been that's for my country
14888 He that has but effected his good will
14889 Hath overta'en mine act
14890 COMINIUS You shall not be
14891 The grave of your deserving Rome must know
14892 The value of her own 'Twere a concealment
14893 Worse than a theft no less than a traducement
14894 To hide your doings and to silence that
14895 Which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd
14896 Would seem but modest Therefore I beseech you
14897 In sign of what you are not to reward
14898 What you have done before our army hear me
14899 MARCIUS I have some wounds upon me and they smart
14900 To hear themselves rememb'red
14901 COMINIUS Should they not
14902 Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude
14903 And tent themselves with death Of all the horses
14904 Whereof we have ta'en good and good store of all
14905 The treasure in this field achiev'd and city
14906 We render you the tenth to be ta'en forth
14907 Before the common distribution at
14908 Your only choice
14909 MARCIUS I thank you General
14910 But cannot make my heart consent to take
14911 A bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it
14912 And stand upon my common part with those
14913 That have beheld the doing
14914 A long flourish They all cry 'Marcius Marcius'
14915 cast up their caps and lances COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
14916 May these same instruments which you profane
14917 Never sound more When drums and trumpets shall
14918 I th field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
14919 Made all of falsefac'd soothing When steel grows
14920 Soft as the parasite's silk let him be made
14921 An overture for th wars No more I say
14922 For that I have not wash'd my nose that bled
14923 Or foil'd some debile wretch which without note
14924 Here's many else have done you shout me forth
14925 In acclamations hyperbolical
14926 As if I lov'd my little should be dieted
14927 In praises sauc'd with lies
14928 COMINIUS Too modest are you
14929 More cruel to your good report than grateful
14930 To us that give you truly By your patience
14931 If 'gainst yourself you be incens'd we'll put you
14932 Like one that means his proper harm in manacles
14933 Then reason safely with you Therefore be it known
14934 As to us to all the world that Caius Marcius
14935 Wears this war's garland in token of the which
14936 My noble steed known to the camp I give him
14937 With all his trim belonging and from this time
14938 For what he did before Corioli can him

14944 CORIOLANUS I will go wash
14945 And when my face is fair you shall perceive
14946 Whether I blush or no Howbeit I thank you
14947 I mean to stride your steed and at all times
14948 To undercrest your good addition
14949 To th fairness of my power

14952 To Rome of our success You Titus Lartius
14953 Must to Corioli back Send us to Rome
14954 The best with whom we may articulate
14955 For their own good and ours
14956 LARTIUS I shall my lord
14957 CORIOLANUS The gods begin to mock me I that now
14958 Refus'd most princely gifts am bound to beg
14959 Of my Lord General
14960 COMINIUS Take't 'tis yours what is't
14961 CORIOLANUS I sometime lay here in Corioli
14962 At a poor man's house he us'd me kindly
14963 He cried to me I saw him prisoner
14964 But then Aufidius was within my view
14965 And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity I request you
14966 To give my poor host freedom
14967 COMINIUS O well begg'd
14968 Were he the butcher of my son he should
14969 Be free as is the wind Deliver him Titus
14970 LARTIUS Marcius his name
14971 CORIOLANUS By Jupiter forgot
14972 I am weary yea my memory is tir'd

14988 And wouldst do so I think should we encounter
14989 As often as we eat By th elements
14990 If e'er again I meet him beard to beard
14991 He's mine or I am his Mine emulation
14992 Hath not that honour in't it had for where
14993 I thought to crush him in an equal force
14994 True sword to sword I'll potch at him some way

15024 ACT II SCENE I
15025 Rome A public place
15026 Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people SICINIUS and BRUTUS
15027 MENENIUS The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
15028 BRUTUS Good or bad
15029 MENENIUS Not according to the prayer of the people for they love
15030 not Marcius
15031 SICINIUS Nature teaches beasts to know their friends
15032 MENENIUS Pray you who does the wolf love
15033 SICINIUS The lamb
15034 MENENIUS Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
15035 noble Marcius
15036 BRUTUS He's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
15037 MENENIUS He's a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb You two are
15038 old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you
15039 BOTH TRIBUNES Well sir
15040 MENENIUS In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
15041 in abundance
15042 BRUTUS He's poor in no one fault but stor'd with all
15043 SICINIUS Especially in pride
15044 BRUTUS And topping all others in boasting
15045 MENENIUS This is strange now Do you two know how you are censured
15046 here in the city I mean of us o th righthand file Do you
15047 BOTH TRIBUNES Why how are we censur'd
15048 MENENIUS Because you talk of pride now will you not be angry
15049 BOTH TRIBUNES Well well sir well
15050 MENENIUS Why 'tis no great matter for a very little thief of
15051 occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your
15052 dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the
15053 least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame
15054 Marcius for being proud
15055 BRUTUS We do it not alone sir
15056 MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone for your helps are
15057 many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your
15058 abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone You talk of
15059 pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
15060 necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O
15061 that you could
15062 BOTH TRIBUNES What then sir
15063 MENENIUS Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
15064 proud violent testy magistratesalias fools as any in Rome
15065 SICINIUS Menenius you are known well enough too
15066 MENENIUS I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves
15067 a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't said to
15068 be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty
15069 and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more
15070 with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
15071 morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath
15072 Meeting two such wealsmen as you are I cannot call you
15073 Lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I
15074 make a crooked face at it I cannot say your worships have
15075 deliver'd the matter well when I find the ass in compound with
15076 the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to
15077 bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie
15078 deadly that tell you you have good faces If you see this in the
15079 map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too
15080 What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
15081 character if I be known well enough too
15082 BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough
15083 MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor any thing You are
15084 ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good
15085 wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and
15086 a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence
15087 to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter
15088 between party and party if you chance to be pinch'd with the
15089 colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag
15090 against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss
15091 the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All
15092 the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
15093 knaves You are a pair of strange ones
15094 BRUTUS Come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
15095 for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol
15096 MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall
15097 encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak
15098 best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your
15099 beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
15100 stuff a botcher's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass's
15101 packsaddle Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud who in a
15102 cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion
15103 though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary
15104 hangmen Godden to your worships More of your conversation
15105 would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
15106 plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you
15107 [BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]
15108 Enter VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA and VALERIA

15124 health in which time I will make a lip at the physician The
15125 most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and to
15126 this preservative of no better report than a horsedrench Is he
15127 not wounded He was wont to come home wounded
15128 VIRGILIA O no no no

15136 got off
15137 MENENIUS And 'twas time for him too I'll warrant him that an he
15138 had stay'd by him I would not have been so fidius'd for all the
15139 chests in Corioli and the gold that's in them Is the Senate
15140 possess'd of this
15141 VOLUMNIA Good ladies let's go Yes yes yes the Senate has

15159 upon him
15160 MENENIUS Now it's twentyseven every gash was an enemy's grave

15162 VOLUMNIA These are the ushers of Marcius Before him he carries
15163 noise and behind him he leaves tears
15164 Death that dark spirit in's nervy arm doth lie
15165 Which being advanc'd declines and then men die

15206 The faults of fools but folly
15207 COMINIUS Ever right
15208 CORIOLANUS Menenius ever ever
15209 HERALD Give way there and go on
15210 CORIOLANUS [To his wife and mother] Your hand and yours
15211 Ere in our own house I do shade my head
15212 The good patricians must be visited
15213 From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings
15214 But with them change of honours
15215 VOLUMNIA I have lived
15216 To see inherited my very wishes
15217 And the buildings of my fancy only
15218 There's one thing wanting which I doubt not but
15219 Our Rome will cast upon thee
15220 CORIOLANUS Know good mother
15221 I had rather be their servant in my way
15222 Than sway with them in theirs
15223 COMINIUS On to the Capitol
15224 [Flourish Cornets Exeunt in state as before]
15225 BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
15226 BRUTUS All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
15227 Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse
15228 Into a rapture lets her baby cry
15229 While she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
15230 Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck
15231 Clamb'ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows
15232 Are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges hors'd
15233 With variable complexions all agreeing
15234 In earnestness to see him Seldshown flamens
15235 Do press among the popular throngs and puff
15236 To win a vulgar station our veil'd dames
15237 Commit the war of white and damask in
15238 Their nicely gawded cheeks to th wanton spoil
15239 Of Phoebus burning kisses Such a pother
15240 As if that whatsoever god who leads him
15241 Were slily crept into his human powers
15242 And gave him graceful posture
15243 SICINIUS On the sudden
15244 I warrant him consul
15245 BRUTUS Then our office may
15246 During his power go sleep
15247 SICINIUS He cannot temp'rately transport his honours
15248 From where he should begin and end but will
15249 Lose those he hath won
15250 BRUTUS In that there's comfort
15251 SICINIUS Doubt not
15252 The commoners for whom we stand but they
15253 Upon their ancient malice will forget
15254 With the least cause these his new honours which
15255 That he will give them make I as little question
15256 As he is proud to do't
15257 BRUTUS I heard him swear
15258 Were he to stand for consul never would he
15259 Appear i th marketplace nor on him put
15260 The napless vesture of humility
15261 Nor showing as the manner is his wounds
15262 To th people beg their stinking breaths
15263 SICINIUS 'Tis right
15264 BRUTUS It was his word O he would miss it rather
15265 Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
15266 And the desire of the nobles
15267 SICINIUS I wish no better
15268 Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
15269 In execution
15270 BRUTUS 'Tis most like he will
15271 SICINIUS It shall be to him then as our good wills
15272 A sure destruction
15273 BRUTUS So it must fall out
15274 To him or our authorities For an end
15275 We must suggest the people in what hatred
15276 He still hath held them that to's power he would
15277 Have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders and
15278 Dispropertied their freedoms holding them
15279 In human action and capacity
15280 Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
15281 Than camels in their war who have their provand
15282 Only for bearing burdens and sore blows
15283 For sinking under them
15284 SICINIUS This as you say suggested
15285 At some time when his soaring insolence
15286 Shall touch the people which time shall not want
15287 If he be put upon't and that's as easy
15288 As to set dogs on sheep will be his fire
15289 To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
15290 Shall darken him for ever
15291 Enter A MESSENGER
15292 BRUTUS What's the matter
15293 MESSENGER You are sent for to the Capitol 'Tis thought
15294 That Marcius shall be consul
15295 I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
15296 The blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves
15297 Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
15298 Upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended
15299 As to Jove's statue and the commons made
15300 A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
15301 I never saw the like
15302 BRUTUS Let's to the Capitol
15303 And carry with us ears and eyes for th time
15304 But hearts for the event
15305 SICINIUS Have with you Exeunt
15306 SCENE II
15307 Rome The Capitol
15308 Enter two OFFICERS to lay cushions as it were in the Capitol
15309 FIRST OFFICER Come come they are almost here How many stand for
15310 consulships
15311 SECOND OFFICER Three they say but 'tis thought of every one
15312 Coriolanus will carry it
15313 FIRST OFFICER That's a brave fellow but he's vengeance proud and
15314 loves not the common people
15315 SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have
15316 flatter'd the people who ne'er loved them and there be many
15317 that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they
15318 love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground
15319 Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
15320 hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
15321 disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
15322 see't
15323 FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no
15324 he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor harm
15325 but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
15326 render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
15327 him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and
15328 displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to
15329 flatter them for their love
15330 SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his
15331 ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been
15332 supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further
15333 deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but
15334 he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
15335 their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
15336 so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise
15337 were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof
15338 and rebuke from every car that heard it
15339 FIRST OFFICER No more of him he's a worthy man Make way they
15340 are coming
15341 A sennet Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
15342 OF THE PEOPLE LICTORS before them CORIOLANUS
15343 MENENIUS COMINIUS the Consul SICINIUS and
15344 BRUTUS take their places by themselves
15345 CORIOLANUS stands
15346 MENENIUS Having determin'd of the Volsces and
15347 To send for Titus Lartius it remains
15348 As the main point of this our aftermeeting
15349 To gratify his noble service that
15350 Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you
15351 Most reverend and grave elders to desire
15352 The present consul and last general
15353 In our wellfound successes to report
15354 A little of that worthy work perform'd
15355 By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom
15356 We met here both to thank and to remember
15357 With honours like himself [CORIOLANUS sits]
15358 FIRST SENATOR Speak good Cominius
15359 Leave nothing out for length and make us think
15360 Rather our state's defective for requital
15361 Than we to stretch it out Masters o th people
15362 We do request your kindest ears and after
15363 Your loving motion toward the common body
15364 To yield what passes here
15365 SICINIUS We are convented
15366 Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
15367 Inclinable to honour and advance
15368 The theme of our assembly
15369 BRUTUS Which the rather
15370 We shall be bless'd to do if he remember
15371 A kinder value of the people than
15372 He hath hereto priz'd them at
15373 MENENIUS That's off that's off
15374 I would you rather had been silent Please you
15375 To hear Cominius speak
15376 BRUTUS Most willingly
15377 But yet my caution was more pertinent
15378 Than the rebuke you give it
15379 MENENIUS He loves your people
15380 But tie him not to be their bedfellow
15381 Worthy Cominius speak
15382 [CORIOLANUS rises and offers to go away]
15383 Nay keep your place
15384 FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus never shame to hear
15385 What you have nobly done
15386 CORIOLANUS Your Honours pardon
15387 I had rather have my wounds to heal again
15388 Than hear say how I got them
15389 BRUTUS Sir I hope
15390 My words disbench'd you not
15391 CORIOLANUS No sir yet oft
15392 When blows have made me stay I fled from words
15393 You sooth'd not therefore hurt not But your people
15394 I love them as they weigh
15395 MENENIUS Pray now sit down
15396 CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun
15397 When the alarum were struck than idly sit
15398 To hear my nothings monster'd Exit
15399 MENENIUS Masters of the people
15400 Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
15401 That's thousand to one good one when you now see
15402 He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
15403 Than one on's ears to hear it Proceed Cominius
15404 COMINIUS I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus
15405 Should not be utter'd feebly It is held
15406 That valour is the chiefest virtue and
15407 Most dignifies the haver If it be
15408 The man I speak of cannot in the world
15409 Be singly counterpois'd At sixteen years
15410 When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought
15411 Beyond the mark of others our then Dictator
15412 Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight
15413 When with his Amazonian chin he drove
15414 The bristled lips before him he bestrid
15415 An o'erpress'd Roman and i th consul's view
15416 Slew three opposers Tarquin's self he met
15417 And struck him on his knee In that day's feats
15418 When he might act the woman in the scene
15419 He prov'd best man i th field and for his meed
15420 Was browbound with the oak His pupil age
15421 Manent'red thus he waxed like a sea
15422 And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
15423 He lurch'd all swords of the garland For this last
15424 Before and in Corioli let me say
15425 I cannot speak him home He stopp'd the fliers
15426 And by his rare example made the coward
15427 Turn terror into sport as weeds before
15428 A vessel under sail so men obey'd
15429 And fell below his stem His sword death's stamp
15430 Where it did mark it took from face to foot
15431 He was a thing of blood whose every motion
15432 Was tim'd with dying cries Alone he ent'red
15433 The mortal gate of th city which he painted
15434 With shunless destiny aidless came off
15435 And with a sudden reenforcement struck
15436 Corioli like a planet Now all's his
15437 When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
15438 His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
15439 Requick'ned what in flesh was fatigate
15440 And to the battle came he where he did
15441 Run reeking o'er the lives of men as if
15442 'Twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd
15443 Both field and city ours he never stood
15444 To ease his breast with panting
15445 MENENIUS Worthy man
15446 FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours
15447 Which we devise him
15448 COMINIUS Our spoils he kick'd at
15449 And look'd upon things precious as they were
15450 The common muck of the world He covets less
15451 Than misery itself would give rewards
15452 His deeds with doing them and is content
15453 To spend the time to end it
15454 MENENIUS He's right noble
15455 Let him be call'd for
15456 FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus
15457 OFFICER He doth appear
15458 Reenter CORIOLANUS
15459 MENENIUS The Senate Coriolanus are well pleas'd
15460 To make thee consul
15461 CORIOLANUS I do owe them still
15462 My life and services
15463 MENENIUS It then remains
15464 That you do speak to the people
15465 CORIOLANUS I do beseech you
15466 Let me o'erleap that custom for I cannot
15467 Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
15468 For my wounds sake to give their suffrage Please you
15469 That I may pass this doing
15470 SICINIUS Sir the people
15471 Must have their voices neither will they bate
15472 One jot of ceremony
15473 MENENIUS Put them not to't
15474 Pray you go fit you to the custom and
15475 Take to you as your predecessors have
15476 Your honour with your form
15477 CORIOLANUS It is a part
15478 That I shall blush in acting and might well
15479 Be taken from the people
15480 BRUTUS Mark you that
15481 CORIOLANUS To brag unto them 'Thus I did and thus'
15482 Show them th unaching scars which I should hide
15483 As if I had receiv'd them for the hire
15484 Of their breath only
15485 MENENIUS Do not stand upon't
15486 We recommend to you Tribunes of the People
15487 Our purpose to them and to our noble consul
15488 Wish we all joy and honour
15489 SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour
15490 [Flourish Cornets Then exeunt all
15491 but SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
15492 BRUTUS You see how he intends to use the people
15493 SICINIUS May they perceive's intent He will require them
15494 As if he did contemn what he requested
15495 Should be in them to give
15496 BRUTUS Come we'll inform them
15497 Of our proceedings here On th marketplace
15498 I know they do attend us Exeunt
15499 SCENE III
15500 Rome The Forum
15501 Enter seven or eight citizens
15502 FIRST CITIZEN Once if he do require our voices we ought not to
15503 deny him
15504 SECOND CITIZEN We may sir if we will
15505 THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
15506 power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds
15507 and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those
15508 wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we
15509 must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is
15510 monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
15511 monster of the multitude of the which we being members should
15512 bring ourselves to be monstrous members
15513 FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of a little help
15514 will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck
15515 not to call us the manyheaded multitude
15516 THIRD CITIZEN We have been call'd so of many not that our heads
15517 are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our
15518 wits are so diversely colour'd and truly I think if all our wits
15519 were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north
15520 south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
15521 all the points o th compass
15522 SECOND CITIZEN Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would
15523 fly
15524 THIRD CITIZEN Nay your wit will not so soon out as another man's
15525 will 'tis strongly wedg'd up in a blockhead but if it were at
15526 liberty 'twould sure southward
15527 SECOND CITIZEN Why that way
15528 THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog where being three parts
15529 melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for
15530 conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
15531 SECOND CITIZEN YOU are never without your tricks you may you
15532 may
15533 THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolv'd to give your voices But that's
15534 no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would
15535 incline to the people there was never a worthier man
15536 Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility
15537 with MENENIUS
15538 Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark his behaviour
15539 We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he
15540 stands by ones by twos and by threes He's to make his
15541 requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single
15542 honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues
15543 therefore follow me and I'll direct you how you shall go by him
15544 ALL Content content Exeunt citizens
15545 MENENIUS O sir you are not right have you not known
15546 The worthiest men have done't
15547 CORIOLANUS What must I say
15548 'I pray sir Plague upon't I cannot bring
15549 My tongue to such a pace 'Look sir my wounds
15550 I got them in my country's service when
15551 Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
15552 From th noise of our own drums'
15553 MENENIUS O me the gods
15554 You must not speak of that You must desire them
15555 To think upon you
15556 CORIOLANUS Think upon me Hang 'em
15557 I would they would forget me like the virtues
15558 Which our divines lose by 'em
15559 MENENIUS You'll mar all
15560 I'll leave you Pray you speak to 'em I pray you
15561 In wholesome manner Exit
15562 Reenter three of the citizens
15563 CORIOLANUS Bid them wash their faces
15564 And keep their teeth clean So here comes a brace
15565 You know the cause sir of my standing here
15566 THIRD CITIZEN We do sir tell us what hath brought you to't
15567 CORIOLANUS Mine own desert
15568 SECOND CITIZEN Your own desert
15569 CORIOLANUS Ay not mine own desire
15570 THIRD CITIZEN How not your own desire
15571 CORIOLANUS No sir 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor
15572 with begging
15573 THIRD CITIZEN YOU MUST think if we give you anything we hope to
15574 gain by you
15575 CORIOLANUS Well then I pray your price o th consulship
15576 FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly
15577 CORIOLANUS Kindly sir I pray let me ha't I have wounds to show
15578 you which shall be yours in private Your good voice sir what
15579 say you
15580 SECOND CITIZEN You shall ha it worthy sir
15581 CORIOLANUS A match sir There's in all two worthy voices begg'd
15582 I have your alms Adieu
15583 THIRD CITIZEN But this is something odd
15584 SECOND CITIZEN An 'twere to give again but 'tis no matter
15585 Exeunt the three citizens
15586 Reenter two other citizens
15587 CORIOLANUS Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
15588 voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown
15589 FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country and you
15590 have not deserved nobly
15591 CORIOLANUS Your enigma
15592 FOURTH CITIZEN You have been a scourge to her enemies you have
15593 been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common
15594 people
15595 CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have
15596 not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn
15597 brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them 'tis a
15598 condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their
15599 choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise
15600 the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That
15601 is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
15602 and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I
15603 may be consul
15604 FIFTH CITIZEN We hope to find you our friend and therefore give
15605 you our voices heartily
15606 FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country
15607 CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I
15608 will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther
15609 BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy sir heartily
15610 Exeunt citizens
15611 CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices
15612 Better it is to die better to starve
15613 Than crave the hire which first we do deserve
15614 Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
15615 To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
15616 Their needless vouches Custom calls me to't
15617 What custom wills in all things should we do't
15618 The dust on antique time would lie unswept
15619 And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
15620 For truth to o'erpeer Rather than fool it so
15621 Let the high office and the honour go
15622 To one that would do thus I am half through
15623 The one part suffered the other will I do
15624 Reenter three citizens more

15670 FIRST CITIZEN No 'tis his kind of speech he did not mock us
15671 SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us save yourself but says
15672 He us'd us scornfully He should have show'd us
15673 His marks of merit wounds receiv'd for's country
15674 SICINIUS Why so he did I am sure
15675 ALL No no no man saw 'em
15676 THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds which he could show in

15682 Here was 'I thank you for your voices Thank you
15683 Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices
15684 I have no further with you Was not this mockery
15685 SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant to see't
15686 Or seeing it of such childish friendliness
15687 To yield your voices
15688 BRUTUS Could you not have told him
15689 As you were lesson'd when he had no power
15690 But was a petty servant to the state
15691 He was your enemy ever spake against
15692 Your liberties and the charters that you bear
15693 I th body of the weal and now arriving
15694 A place of potency and sway o th state
15695 If he should still malignantly remain
15696 Fast foe to th plebeii your voices might
15697 Be curses to yourselves You should have said
15698 That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
15699 Than what he stood for so his gracious nature
15700 Would think upon you for your voices and
15701 Translate his malice towards you into love
15702 Standing your friendly lord
15703 SICINIUS Thus to have said
15704 As you were foreadvis'd had touch'd his spirit
15705 And tried his inclination from him pluck'd
15706 Either his gracious promise which you might
15707 As cause had call'd you up have held him to
15708 Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature
15709 Which easily endures not article
15710 Tying him to aught So putting him to rage
15711 You should have ta'en th advantage of his choler
15712 And pass'd him unelected
15713 BRUTUS Did you perceive
15714 He did solicit you in free contempt
15715 When he did need your loves and do you think
15716 That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
15717 When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies
15718 No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry
15719 Against the rectorship of judgment
15720 SICINIUS Have you
15721 Ere now denied the asker and now again
15722 Of him that did not ask but mock bestow
15723 Your su'dfor tongues
15724 THIRD CITIZEN He's not confirm'd we may deny him yet
15725 SECOND CITIZENS And will deny him
15726 I'll have five hundred voices of that sound
15727 FIRST CITIZEN I twice five hundred and their friends to piece
15728 'em
15729 BRUTUS Get you hence instantly and tell those friends
15730 They have chose a consul that will from them take
15731 Their liberties make them of no more voice
15732 Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
15733 As therefore kept to do so
15734 SICINIUS Let them assemble
15735 And on a safer judgment all revoke
15736 Your ignorant election Enforce his pride
15737 And his old hate unto you besides forget not
15738 With what contempt he wore the humble weed
15739 How in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves
15740 Thinking upon his services took from you
15741 Th apprehension of his present portance
15742 Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
15743 After the inveterate hate he bears you
15744 BRUTUS Lay
15745 A fault on us your tribunes that we labour'd
15746 No impediment between but that you must
15747 Cast your election on him
15748 SICINIUS Say you chose him
15749 More after our commandment than as guided
15750 By your own true affections and that your minds
15751 Preoccupied with what you rather must do
15752 Than what you should made you against the grain
15753 To voice him consul Lay the fault on us
15754 BRUTUS Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you
15755 How youngly he began to serve his country
15756 How long continued and what stock he springs of
15757 The noble house o th Marcians from whence came
15758 That Ancus Marcius Numa's daughter's son
15759 Who after great Hostilius here was king
15760 Of the same house Publius and Quintus were
15761 That our best water brought by conduits hither
15762 And Censorinus nobly named so
15763 Twice being by the people chosen censor
15764 Was his great ancestor
15765 SICINIUS One thus descended
15766 That hath beside well in his person wrought
15767 To be set high in place we did commend
15768 To your remembrances but you have found
15769 Scaling his present bearing with his past
15770 That he's your fixed enemy and revoke
15771 Your sudden approbation
15772 BRUTUS Say you ne'er had done't
15773 Harp on that still but by our putting on
15774 And presently when you have drawn your number
15775 Repair to th Capitol
15776 CITIZENS will will so almost all
15777 Repent in their election Exeunt plebeians
15778 BRUTUS Let them go on
15779 This mutiny were better put in hazard
15780 Than stay past doubt for greater
15781 If as his nature is he fall in rage
15782 With their refusal both observe and answer
15783 The vantage of his anger
15784 SICINIUS To th Capitol come
15785 We will be there before the stream o th people
15786 And this shall seem as partly 'tis their own
15787 Which we have goaded onward Exeunt
15788 ACT III SCENE I
15789 Rome A street
15790 Cornets Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS all the GENTRY COMINIUS
15791 TITUS LARTIUS and other SENATORS
15792 CORIOLANUS Tullus Aufidius then had made new head
15793 LARTIUS He had my lord and that it was which caus'd
15794 Our swifter composition
15795 CORIOLANUS So then the Volsces stand but as at first
15796 Ready when time shall prompt them to make road
15797 Upon's again
15798 COMINIUS They are worn Lord Consul so
15799 That we shall hardly in our ages see
15800 Their banners wave again
15801 CORIOLANUS Saw you Aufidius
15802 LARTIUS On safeguard he came to me and did curse
15803 Against the Volsces for they had so vilely
15804 Yielded the town He is retir'd to Antium
15805 CORIOLANUS Spoke he of me
15806 LARTIUS He did my lord
15807 CORIOLANUS How What
15808 LARTIUS How often he had met you sword to sword
15809 That of all things upon the earth he hated
15810 Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
15811 To hopeless restitution so he might
15812 Be call'd your vanquisher
15813 CORIOLANUS At Antium lives he
15814 LARTIUS At Antium
15815 CORIOLANUS I wish I had a cause to seek him there
15816 To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home
15817 Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
15818 Behold these are the tribunes of the people
15819 The tongues o th common mouth I do despise them
15820 For they do prank them in authority
15821 Against all noble sufferance
15822 SICINIUS Pass no further
15823 CORIOLANUS Ha What is that
15824 BRUTUS It will be dangerous to go on no further
15825 CORIOLANUS What makes this change
15826 MENENIUS The matter
15827 COMINIUS Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common
15828 BRUTUS Cominius no
15829 CORIOLANUS Have I had children's voices
15830 FIRST SENATOR Tribunes give way he shall to th marketplace
15831 BRUTUS The people are incens'd against him
15832 SICINIUS Stop
15833 Or all will fall in broil
15834 CORIOLANUS Are these your herd
15835 Must these have voices that can yield them now
15836 And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices
15837 You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
15838 Have you not set them on
15839 MENENIUS Be calm be calm
15840 CORIOLANUS It is a purpos'd thing and grows by plot
15841 To curb the will of the nobility
15842 Suffer't and live with such as cannot rule
15843 Nor ever will be rul'd
15844 BRUTUS Call't not a plot
15845 The people cry you mock'd them and of late
15846 When corn was given them gratis you repin'd
15847 Scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them
15848 Timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
15849 CORIOLANUS Why this was known before
15850 BRUTUS Not to them all
15851 CORIOLANUS Have you inform'd them sithence
15852 BRUTUS How I inform them
15853 COMINIUS You are like to do such business
15854 BRUTUS Not unlike
15855 Each way to better yours
15856 CORIOLANUS Why then should I be consul By yond clouds
15857 Let me deserve so ill as you and make me
15858 Your fellow tribune
15859 SICINIUS You show too much of that
15860 For which the people stir if you will pass
15861 To where you are bound you must enquire your way
15862 Which you are out of with a gentler spirit
15863 Or never be so noble as a consul
15864 Nor yoke with him for tribune
15865 MENENIUS Let's be calm
15866 COMINIUS The people are abus'd set on This palt'ring
15867 Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus
15868 Deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely
15869 I th plain way of his merit
15870 CORIOLANUS Tell me of corn
15871 This was my speech and I will speak't again
15872 MENENIUS Not now not now
15873 FIRST SENATOR Not in this heat sir now
15874 CORIOLANUS Now as I live I will
15875 My nobler friends I crave their pardons
15876 For the mutable rankscented meiny let them
15877 Regard me as I do not flatter and
15878 Therein behold themselves I say again
15879 In soothing them we nourish 'gainst our Senate
15880 The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
15881 Which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd
15882 By mingling them with us the honour'd number
15883 Who lack not virtue no nor power but that
15884 Which they have given to beggars
15885 MENENIUS Well no more
15886 FIRST SENATOR No more words we beseech you
15887 CORIOLANUS How no more
15888 As for my country I have shed my blood
15889 Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
15890 Coin words till their decay against those measles
15891 Which we disdain should tetter us yet sought
15892 The very way to catch them
15893 BRUTUS You speak o th people
15894 As if you were a god to punish not
15895 A man of their infirmity
15896 SICINIUS 'Twere well
15897 We let the people know't
15898 MENENIUS What what his choler
15899 CORIOLANUS Choler
15900 Were I as patient as the midnight sleep
15901 By Jove 'twould be my mind
15902 SICINIUS It is a mind
15903 That shall remain a poison where it is
15904 Not poison any further
15905 CORIOLANUS Shall remain
15906 Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you
15907 His absolute 'shall'
15908 COMINIUS 'Twas from the canon
15909 CORIOLANUS 'Shall'
15910 O good but most unwise patricians Why
15911 You grave but reckless senators have you thus
15912 Given Hydra here to choose an officer
15913 That with his peremptory 'shall being but
15914 The horn and noise o th monster's wants not spirit
15915 To say he'll turn your current in a ditch
15916 And make your channel his If he have power
15917 Then vail your ignorance if none awake
15918 Your dangerous lenity If you are learn'd
15919 Be not as common fools if you are not
15920 Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians
15921 If they be senators and they are no less
15922 When both your voices blended the great'st taste
15923 Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate
15924 And such a one as he who puts his 'shall'
15925 His popular 'shall against a graver bench
15926 Than ever frown'd in Greece By Jove himself
15927 It makes the consuls base and my soul aches
15928 To know when two authorities are up
15929 Neither supreme how soon confusion
15930 May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
15931 The one by th other
15932 COMINIUS Well on to th marketplace
15933 CORIOLANUS Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
15934 The corn o th storehouse gratis as 'twas us'd
15935 Sometime in Greece
15936 MENENIUS Well well no more of that
15937 CORIOLANUS Though there the people had more absolute pow'r
15938 I say they nourish'd disobedience fed
15939 The ruin of the state
15940 BRUTUS Why shall the people give
15941 One that speaks thus their voice
15942 CORIOLANUS I'll give my reasons
15943 More worthier than their voices They know the corn
15944 Was not our recompense resting well assur'd
15945 They ne'er did service for't being press'd to th war
15946 Even when the navel of the state was touch'd
15947 They would not thread the gates This kind of service
15948 Did not deserve corn gratis Being i th war
15949 Their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd
15950 Most valour spoke not for them Th accusation
15951 Which they have often made against the Senate
15952 All cause unborn could never be the native
15953 Of our so frank donation Well what then
15954 How shall this bosom multiplied digest
15955 The Senate's courtesy Let deeds express
15956 What's like to be their words 'We did request it
15957 We are the greater poll and in true fear
15958 They gave us our demands Thus we debase
15959 The nature of our seats and make the rabble
15960 Call our cares fears which will in time
15961 Break ope the locks o th Senate and bring in
15962 The crows to peck the eagles
15963 MENENIUS Come enough
15964 BRUTUS Enough with over measure
15965 CORIOLANUS No take more
15966 What may be sworn by both divine and human
15967 Seal what I end withal This double worship
15968 Where one part does disdain with cause the other
15969 Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
15970 Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
15971 Of general ignorance it must omit
15972 Real necessities and give way the while
15973 To unstable slightness Purpose so barr'd it follows
15974 Nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you
15975 You that will be less fearful than discreet
15976 That love the fundamental part of state
15977 More than you doubt the change on't that prefer
15978 A noble life before a long and wish
15979 To jump a body with a dangerous physic
15980 That's sure of death without it at once pluck out
15981 The multitudinous tongue let them not lick
15982 The sweet which is their poison Your dishonour
15983 Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
15984 Of that integrity which should become't
15985 Not having the power to do the good it would
15986 For th ill which doth control't
15987 BRUTUS Has said enough
15988 SICINIUS Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
15989 As traitors do
15990 CORIOLANUS Thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee
15991 What should the people do with these bald tribunes
15992 On whom depending their obedience fails
15993 To the greater bench In a rebellion
15994 When what's not meet but what must be was law
15995 Then were they chosen in a better hour
15996 Let what is meet be said it must be meet
15997 And throw their power i th dust
15998 BRUTUS Manifest treason
15999 SICINIUS This a consul No
16000 BRUTUS The aediles ho
16001 Enter an AEDILE
16002 Let him be apprehended
16003 SICINIUS Go call the people [Exit AEDILE] in whose name myself
16004 Attach thee as a traitorous innovator
16005 A foe to th public weal Obey I charge thee
16006 And follow to thine answer
16007 CORIOLANUS Hence old goat
16008 PATRICIANS We'll surety him
16009 COMINIUS Ag'd sir hands off
16010 CORIOLANUS Hence rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones
16011 Out of thy garments
16012 SICINIUS Help ye citizens
16013 Enter a rabble of plebeians with the AEDILES
16014 MENENIUS On both sides more respect
16015 SICINIUS Here's he that would take from you all your power
16016 BRUTUS Seize him aediles
16017 PLEBEIANS Down with him down with him

16030 Marcius would have all from you Marcius
16031 Whom late you have nam'd for consul
16032 MENENIUS Fie fie fie
16033 This is the way to kindle not to quench
16034 FIRST SENATOR To unbuild the city and to lay all flat
16035 SICINIUS What is the city but the people
16036 PLEBEIANS True
16037 The people are the city
16038 BRUTUS By the consent of all we were establish'd
16039 The people's magistrates
16040 PLEBEIANS You so remain
16041 MENENIUS And so are like to do
16042 COMINIUS That is the way to lay the city flat
16043 To bring the roof to the foundation
16044 And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
16045 In heaps and piles of ruin
16046 SICINIUS This deserves death
16047 BRUTUS Or let us stand to our authority
16048 Or let us lose it We do here pronounce
16049 Upon the part o th people in whose power
16050 We were elected theirs Marcius is worthy
16051 Of present death
16052 SICINIUS Therefore lay hold of him
16053 Bear him to th rock Tarpeian and from thence
16054 Into destruction cast him
16055 BRUTUS AEdiles seize him
16056 PLEBEIANS Yield Marcius yield
16057 MENENIUS Hear me one word beseech you Tribunes
16058 Hear me but a word
16059 AEDILES Peace peace
16060 MENENIUS Be that you seem truly your country's friend
16061 And temp'rately proceed to what you would
16062 Thus violently redress
16063 BRUTUS Sir those cold ways
16064 That seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
16065 Where the disease is violent Lay hands upon him
16066 And bear him to the rock
16067 [CORIOLANUS draws his sword]
16068 CORIOLANUS No I'll die here
16069 There's some among you have beheld me fighting
16070 Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
16071 MENENIUS Down with that sword Tribunes withdraw awhile
16072 BRUTUS Lay hands upon him
16073 MENENIUS Help Marcius help
16074 You that be noble help him young and old
16075 PLEBEIANS Down with him down with him
16076 [In this mutiny the TRIBUNES the AEDILES
16077 and the people are beat in]
16078 MENENIUS Go get you to your house be gone away
16079 All will be nought else
16080 SECOND SENATOR Get you gone
16081 CORIOLANUS Stand fast
16082 We have as many friends as enemies
16083 MENENIUS Shall it be put to that
16084 FIRST SENATOR The gods forbid
16085 I prithee noble friend home to thy house

16087 MENENIUS For 'tis a sore upon us
16088 You cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
16089 COMINIUS Come sir along with us
16090 CORIOLANUS I would they were barbarians as they are
16091 Though in Rome litter'd not Romans as they are not
16092 Though calved i th porch o th Capitol
16093 MENENIUS Be gone
16094 Put not your worthy rage into your tongue
16095 One time will owe another
16096 CORIOLANUS On fair ground
16097 I could beat forty of them
16098 MENENIUS I could myself
16099 Take up a brace o th best of them yea the two tribunes
16100 COMINIUS But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic
16101 And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands
16102 Against a falling fabric Will you hence
16103 Before the tag return whose rage doth rend
16104 Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
16105 What they are us'd to bear
16106 MENENIUS Pray you be gone
16107 I'll try whether my old wit be in request
16108 With those that have but little this must be patch'd
16109 With cloth of any colour
16110 COMINIUS Nay come away
16111 Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS with others
16112 PATRICIANS This man has marr'd his fortune
16113 MENENIUS His nature is too noble for the world
16114 He would not flatter Neptune for his trident
16115 Or Jove for's power to thunder His heart's his mouth
16116 What his breast forges that his tongue must vent
16117 And being angry does forget that ever
16118 He heard the name of death [A noise within]
16119 Here's goodly work
16120 PATRICIANS I would they were abed
16121 MENENIUS I would they were in Tiber
16122 What the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair
16123 Reenter BRUTUS and SICINIUS the rabble again
16124 SICINIUS Where is this viper
16125 That would depopulate the city and
16126 Be every man himself
16127 MENENIUS You worthy Tribunes
16128 SICINIUS He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
16129 With rigorous hands he hath resisted law
16130 And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
16131 Than the severity of the public power
16132 Which he so sets at nought
16133 FIRST CITIZEN He shall well know
16134 The noble tribunes are the people's mouths
16135 And we their hands
16136 PLEBEIANS He shall sure on't
16137 MENENIUS Sir sir
16138 SICINIUS Peace
16139 MENENIUS Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
16140 With modest warrant
16141 SICINIUS Sir how comes't that you
16142 Have holp to make this rescue
16143 MENENIUS Hear me speak
16144 As I do know the consul's worthiness
16145 So can I name his faults
16146 SICINIUS Consul What consul
16147 MENENIUS The consul Coriolanus
16148 BRUTUS He consul
16149 PLEBEIANS No no no no no
16150 MENENIUS If by the tribunes leave and yours good people
16151 I may be heard I would crave a word or two
16152 The which shall turn you to no further harm
16153 Than so much loss of time
16154 SICINIUS Speak briefly then
16155 For we are peremptory to dispatch
16156 This viperous traitor to eject him hence
16157 Were but one danger and to keep him here
16158 Our certain death therefore it is decreed
16159 He dies tonight
16160 MENENIUS Now the good gods forbid
16161 That our renowned Rome whose gratitude
16162 Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
16163 In Jove's own book like an unnatural dam
16164 Should now eat up her own
16165 SICINIUS He's a disease that must be cut away
16166 MENENIUS O he's a limb that has but a disease
16167 Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
16168 What has he done to Rome that's worthy death
16169 Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
16170 Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
16171 By many an ounce he dropt it for his country
16172 And what is left to lose it by his country
16173 Were to us all that do't and suffer it
16174 A brand to th end o th world
16175 SICINIUS This is clean kam
16176 BRUTUS Merely awry When he did love his country
16177 It honour'd him
16178 SICINIUS The service of the foot
16179 Being once gangren'd is not then respected
16180 For what before it was
16181 BRUTUS We'll hear no more
16182 Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
16183 Lest his infection being of catching nature
16184 Spread further
16185 MENENIUS One word more one word
16186 This tigerfooted rage when it shall find
16187 The harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late
16188 Tie leaden pounds to's heels Proceed by process
16189 Lest parties as he is belov'd break out
16190 And sack great Rome with Romans
16191 BRUTUS If it were so
16192 SICINIUS What do ye talk
16193 Have we not had a taste of his obedience
16194 Our aediles smote ourselves resisted Come
16195 MENENIUS Consider this he has been bred i th wars
16196 Since 'a could draw a sword and is ill school'd
16197 In bolted language meal and bran together
16198 He throws without distinction Give me leave
16199 I'll go to him and undertake to bring him
16200 Where he shall answer by a lawful form
16201 In peace to his utmost peril
16202 FIRST SENATOR Noble Tribunes
16203 It is the humane way the other course
16204 Will prove too bloody and the end of it
16205 Unknown to the beginning
16206 SICINIUS Noble Menenius
16207 Be you then as the people's officer
16208 Masters lay down your weapons
16209 BRUTUS Go not home
16210 SICINIUS Meet on the marketplace We'll attend you there
16211 Where if you bring not Marcius we'll proceed
16212 In our first way
16213 MENENIUS I'll bring him to you
16214 [To the SENATORS] Let me desire your company he must come
16215 Or what is worst will follow
16216 FIRST SENATOR Pray you let's to him Exeunt
16217 SCENE II
16218 Rome The house of CORIOLANUS
16219 Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES
16220 CORIOLANUS Let them pull all about mine ears present me
16221 Death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
16222 Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock
16223 That the precipitation might down stretch
16224 Below the beam of sight yet will I still
16225 Be thus to them
16226 FIRST PATRICIAN You do the nobler
16227 CORIOLANUS I muse my mother
16228 Does not approve me further who was wont
16229 To call them woollen vassals things created
16230 To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
16231 In congregations to yawn be still and wonder
16232 When one but of my ordinance stood up
16233 To speak of peace or war
16234 Enter VOLUMNIA
16235 I talk of you
16236 Why did you wish me milder Would you have me
16237 False to my nature Rather say I play
16238 The man I am
16239 VOLUMNIA O sir sir sir
16240 I would have had you put your power well on
16241 Before you had worn it out
16242 CORIOLANUS Let go
16243 VOLUMNIA You might have been enough the man you are
16244 With striving less to be so lesser had been
16245 The thwartings of your dispositions if
16246 You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd
16247 Ere they lack'd power to cross you
16248 CORIOLANUS Let them hang
16249 VOLUMNIA Ay and burn too
16250 Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS
16251 MENENIUS Come come you have been too rough something too rough
16252 You must return and mend it
16253 FIRST SENATOR There's no remedy
16254 Unless by not so doing our good city
16255 Cleave in the midst and perish
16256 VOLUMNIA Pray be counsell'd
16257 I have a heart as little apt as yours
16258 But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
16259 To better vantage
16260 MENENIUS Well said noble woman
16261 Before he should thus stoop to th herd but that
16262 The violent fit o th time craves it as physic
16263 For the whole state I would put mine armour on
16264 Which I can scarcely bear
16265 CORIOLANUS What must I do
16266 MENENIUS Return to th tribunes
16267 CORIOLANUS Well what then what then
16268 MENENIUS Repent what you have spoke
16269 CORIOLANUS For them I cannot do it to the gods
16270 Must I then do't to them
16271 VOLUMNIA You are too absolute
16272 Though therein you can never be too noble
16273 But when extremities speak I have heard you say
16274 Honour and policy like unsever'd friends
16275 I th war do grow together grant that and tell me
16276 In peace what each of them by th other lose
16277 That they combine not there
16278 CORIOLANUS Tush tush
16279 MENENIUS A good demand
16280 VOLUMNIA If it be honour in your wars to seem
16281 The same you are not which for your best ends
16282 You adopt your policy how is it less or worse
16283 That it shall hold companionship in peace
16284 With honour as in war since that to both
16285 It stands in like request
16286 CORIOLANUS Why force you this
16287 VOLUMNIA Because that now it lies you on to speak
16288 To th people not by your own instruction
16289 Nor by th matter which your heart prompts you
16290 But with such words that are but roted in
16291 Your tongue though but bastards and syllables
16292 Of no allowance to your bosom's truth
16293 Now this no more dishonours you at all
16294 Than to take in a town with gentle words
16295 Which else would put you to your fortune and
16296 The hazard of much blood
16297 I would dissemble with my nature where
16298 My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd
16299 I should do so in honour I am in this
16300 Your wife your son these senators the nobles
16301 And you will rather show our general louts
16302 How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em
16303 For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
16304 Of what that want might ruin
16305 MENENIUS Noble lady
16306 Come go with us speak fair you may salve so
16307 Not what is dangerous present but the los
16308 Of what is past
16309 VOLUMNIA I prithee now My son
16310 Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
16311 And thus far having stretch'd it here be with them
16312 Thy knee bussing the stones for in such busines
16313 Action is eloquence and the eyes of th ignorant
16314 More learned than the ears waving thy head
16315 Which often thus correcting thystout heart
16316 Now humble as the ripest mulberry
16317 That will not hold the handling Or say to them
16318 Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
16319 Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
16320 Were fit for thee to use as they to claim
16321 In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
16322 Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
16323 As thou hast power and person
16324 MENENIUS This but done
16325 Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
16326 For they have pardons being ask'd as free
16327 As words to little purpose
16328 VOLUMNIA Prithee now
16329 Go and be rul'd although I know thou hadst rather
16330 Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
16331 Than flatter him in a bower
16332 Enter COMINIUS
16333 Here is Cominius
16334 COMINIUS I have been i th marketplace and sir 'tis fit
16335 You make strong party or defend yourself
16336 By calmness or by absence all's in anger
16337 MENENIUS Only fair speech
16338 COMINIUS I think 'twill serve if he
16339 Can thereto frame his spirit
16340 VOLUMNIA He must and will
16341 Prithee now say you will and go about it
16342 CORIOLANUS Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce Must I
16343 With my base tongue give to my noble heart
16344 A lie that it must bear Well I will do't
16345 Yet were there but this single plot to lose
16346 This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it
16347 And throw't against the wind To th marketplace
16348 You have put me now to such a part which never
16349 I shall discharge to th life
16350 COMINIUS Come come we'll prompt you
16351 VOLUMNIA I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
16352 My praises made thee first a soldier so
16353 To have my praise for this perform a part
16354 Thou hast not done before
16355 CORIOLANUS Well I must do't
16356 Away my disposition and possess me
16357 Some harlot's spirit My throat of war be turn'd
16358 Which quier'd with my drum into a pipe
16359 Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
16360 That babies lulls asleep The smiles of knaves
16361 Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
16362 The glasses of my sight A beggar's tongue
16363 Make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees
16364 Who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his
16365 That hath receiv'd an alms I will not do't
16366 Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
16367 And by my body's action teach my mind
16368 A most inherent baseness
16369 VOLUMNIA At thy choice then
16370 To beg of thee it is my more dishonour
16371 Than thou of them Come all to ruin Let
16372 Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
16373 Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death
16374 With as big heart as thou Do as thou list
16375 Thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me
16376 But owe thy pride thyself
16377 CORIOLANUS Pray be content
16378 Mother I am going to the marketplace
16379 Chide me no more I'll mountebank their loves
16380 Cog their hearts from them and come home belov'd
16381 Of all the trades in Rome Look I am going
16382 Commend me to my wife I'll return consul
16383 Or never trust to what my tongue can do
16384 I th way of flattery further
16385 VOLUMNIA Do your will Exit
16386 COMINIUS Away The tribunes do attend you Arm yourself
16387 To answer mildly for they are prepar'd
16388 With accusations as I hear more strong
16389 Than are upon you yet
16390 CORIOLANUS The word is 'mildly Pray you let us go
16391 Let them accuse me by invention I
16392 Will answer in mine honour
16393 MENENIUS Ay but mildly
16394 CORIOLANUS Well mildly be it then mildly Exeunt

16398 BRUTUS In this point charge him home that he affects
16399 Tyrannical power If he evade us there

16415 SICINIUS Assemble presently the people hither
16416 And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
16417 I th right and strength o th commons be it either
16418 For death for fine or banishment then let them
16419 If I say fine cry 'Fine if death cry 'Death'
16420 Insisting on the old prerogative
16421 And power i th truth o th cause
16422 AEDILE I shall inform them
16423 BRUTUS And when such time they have begun to cry
16424 Let them not cease but with a din confus'd
16425 Enforce the present execution
16426 Of what we chance to sentence
16427 AEDILE Very well
16428 SICINIUS Make them be strong and ready for this hint
16429 When we shall hap to give't them
16430 BRUTUS Go about it Exit AEDILE
16431 Put him to choler straight He hath been us'd
16432 Ever to conquer and to have his worth
16433 Of contradiction being once chaf'd he cannot
16434 Be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks
16435 What's in his heart and that is there which looks
16436 With us to break his neck
16437 Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS and COMINIUS with others
16438 SICINIUS Well here he comes
16439 MENENIUS Calmly I do beseech you
16440 CORIOLANUS Ay as an ostler that for th poorest piece
16441 Will bear the knave by th volume Th honour'd gods
16442 Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice
16443 Supplied with worthy men plant love among's
16444 Throng our large temples with the shows of peace
16445 And not our streets with war
16446 FIRST SENATOR Amen amen

16453 CORIOLANUS Shall I be charg'd no further than this present
16454 Must all determine here
16455 SICINIUS I do demand
16456 If you submit you to the people's voices
16457 Allow their officers and are content
16458 To suffer lawful censure for such faults
16459 As shall be prov'd upon you
16460 CORIOLANUS I am content
16461 MENENIUS Lo citizens he says he is content
16462 The warlike service he has done consider think
16463 Upon the wounds his body bears which show
16464 Like graves i th holy churchyard
16465 CORIOLANUS Scratches with briers
16466 Scars to move laughter only
16467 MENENIUS Consider further
16468 That when he speaks not like a citizen
16469 You find him like a soldier do not take
16470 His rougher accents for malicious sounds
16471 But as I say such as become a soldier
16472 Rather than envy you
16473 COMINIUS Well well No more
16474 CORIOLANUS What is the matter
16475 That being pass'd for consul with full voice
16476 I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
16477 You take it off again
16478 SICINIUS Answer to us
16479 CORIOLANUS Say then 'tis true I ought so
16480 SICINIUS We charge you that you have contriv'd to take
16481 From Rome all season'd office and to wind
16482 Yourself into a power tyrannical
16483 For which you are a traitor to the people
16484 CORIOLANUS How traitor
16485 MENENIUS Nay temperately Your promise
16486 CORIOLANUS The fires i th lowest hell fold in the people
16487 Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune
16488 Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
16489 In thy hands clutch'd as many millions in
16490 Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say
16491 'Thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
16492 As I do pray the gods
16493 SICINIUS Mark you this people
16494 PLEBEIANS To th rock to th rock with him
16495 SICINIUS Peace
16496 We need not put new matter to his charge
16497 What you have seen him do and heard him speak
16498 Beating your officers cursing yourselves
16499 Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
16500 Those whose great power must try him even this
16501 So criminal and in such capital kind
16502 Deserves th extremest death
16503 BRUTUS But since he hath
16504 Serv'd well for Rome
16505 CORIOLANUS What do you prate of service
16506 BRUTUS I talk of that that know it
16507 CORIOLANUS You
16508 MENENIUS Is this the promise that you made your mother
16509 COMINIUS Know I pray you
16510 CORIOLANUS I'll know no further
16511 Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death
16512 Vagabond exile flaying pent to linger
16513 But with a grain a day I would not buy
16514 Their mercy at the price of one fair word
16515 Nor check my courage for what they can give
16516 To have't with saying 'Good morrow'
16517 SICINIUS For that he has
16518 As much as in him lies from time to time
16519 Envied against the people seeking means
16520 To pluck away their power as now at last
16521 Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
16522 Of dreaded justice but on the ministers
16523 That do distribute it in the name o th people
16524 And in the power of us the tribunes we
16525 Ev'n from this instant banish him our city
16526 In peril of precipitation
16527 From off the rock Tarpeian never more
16528 To enter our Rome gates I th people's name
16529 I say it shall be so
16530 PLEBEIANS It shall be so it shall be so Let him away
16531 He's banish'd and it shall be so

16534 COMINIUS Let me speak
16535 I have been consul and can show for Rome
16536 Her enemies marks upon me I do love
16537 My country's good with a respect more tender
16538 More holy and profound than mine own life
16539 My dear wife's estimate her womb's increase
16540 And treasure of my loins Then if I would
16541 Speak that
16542 SICINIUS We know your drift Speak what
16543 BRUTUS There's no more to be said but he is banish'd
16544 As enemy to the people and his country
16545 It shall be so
16546 PLEBEIANS It shall be so it shall be so
16547 CORIOLANUS YOU common cry of curs whose breath I hate
16548 As reek o th rotten fens whose loves I prize
16549 As the dead carcasses of unburied men
16550 That do corrupt my air I banish you
16551 And here remain with your uncertainty
16552 Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
16553 Your enemies with nodding of their plumes
16554 Fan you into despair Have the power still
16555 To banish your defenders till at length
16556 Your ignorance which finds not till it feels
16557 Making but reservation of yourselves
16558 Still your own foes deliver you
16559 As most abated captives to some nation
16560 That won you without blows Despising
16561 For you the city thus I turn my back
16562 There is a world elsewhere

16571 Attend us through the city
16572 PLEBEIANS Come come let's see him out at gates come
16573 The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come Exeunt

16586 CORIOLANUS Come leave your tears a brief farewell The beast
16587 With many heads butts me away Nay mother
16588 Where is your ancient courage You were us'd
16589 To say extremities was the trier of spirits
16590 That common chances common men could bear
16591 That when the sea was calm all boats alike
16592 Show'd mastership in floating fortune's blows
16593 When most struck home being gentle wounded craves
16594 A noble cunning You were us'd to load me
16595 With precepts that would make invincible
16596 The heart that conn'd them

16598 CORIOLANUS Nay I prithee woman
16599 VOLUMNIA Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome

16606 Your husband so much sweat Cominius
16607 Droop not adieu Farewell my wife my mother
16608 I'll do well yet Thou old and true Menenius
16609 Thy tears are salter than a younger man's
16610 And venomous to thine eyes My sometime General
16611 I have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld
16612 Hearthard'ning spectacles tell these sad women
16613 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
16614 As 'tis to laugh at 'em My mother you wot well
16615 My hazards still have been your solace and
16616 Believe't not lightly though I go alone
16617 Like to a lonely dragon that his fen
16618 Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen your son
16619 Will or exceed the common or be caught
16620 With cautelous baits and practice
16621 VOLUMNIA My first son
16622 Whither wilt thou go Take good Cominius
16623 With thee awhile determine on some course
16624 More than a wild exposture to each chance
16625 That starts i th way before thee
16626 VIRGILIA O the gods
16627 COMINIUS I'll follow thee a month devise with the
16628 Where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
16629 And we of thee so if the time thrust forth
16630 A cause for thy repeal we shall not send
16631 O'er the vast world to seek a single man
16632 And lose advantage which doth ever cool
16633 I th absence of the needer
16634 CORIOLANUS Fare ye well
16635 Thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
16636 Of the wars surfeits to go rove with one
16637 That's yet unbruis'd bring me but out at gate
16638 Come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
16639 My friends of noble touch when I am forth
16640 Bid me farewell and smile I pray you come
16641 While I remain above the ground you shall
16642 Hear from me still and never of me aught
16643 But what is like me formerly
16644 MENENIUS That's worthily
16645 As any ear can hear Come let's not weep
16646 If I could shake off but one seven years
16647 From these old arms and legs by the good gods
16648 I'd with thee every foot
16649 CORIOLANUS Give me thy hand
16650 Come Exeunt

16888 But with that surname a good memory
16889 And witness of the malice and displeasure

16917 And cannot live but to thy shame unless
16918 It be to do thee service
16919 AUFIDIUS O Marcius Marcius
16920 Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
16921 A root of ancient envy If Jupiter
16922 Should from yond cloud speak divine things
16923 And say ''Tis true I'd not believe them more
16924 Than thee all noble Marcius Let me twine
16925 Mine arms about that body where against
16926 My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
16927 And scarr'd the moon with splinters here I clip
16928 The anvil of my sword and do contest
16929 As hotly and as nobly with thy love
16930 As ever in ambitious strength I did
16931 Contend against thy valour Know thou first
16932 I lov'd the maid I married never man
16933 Sigh'd truer breath but that I see thee here
16934 Thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
16935 Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
16936 Bestride my threshold Why thou Mars I tell the
16937 We have a power on foot and I had purpose
16938 Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
16939 Or lose mine arm for't Thou hast beat me out
16940 Twelve several times and I have nightly since
16941 Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me
16942 We have been down together in my sleep
16943 Unbuckling helms fisting each other's throat
16944 And wak'd half dead with nothing Worthy Marcius
16945 Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
16946 Thou art thence banish'd we would muster all
16947 From twelve to seventy and pouring war
16948 Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome
16949 Like a bold flood o'erbeat O come go in
16950 And take our friendly senators by th hands
16951 Who now are here taking their leaves of me
16952 Who am prepar'd against your territories
16953 Though not for Rome itself
16954 CORIOLANUS You bless me gods
16955 AUFIDIUS Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
16956 The leading of thine own revenges take
16957 Th one half of my commission and set down
16958 As best thou art experienc'd since thou know'st
16959 Thy country's strength and weakness thine own ways
16960 Whether to knock against the gates of Rome
16961 Or rudely visit them in parts remote
16962 To fright them ere destroy But come in
16963 Let me commend thee first to those that shall
16964 Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes
16965 And more a friend than e'er an enemy
16966 Yet Marcius that was much Your hand most welcome
16967 Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
16968 The two SERVINGMEN come forward
16969 FIRST SERVANT Here's a strange alteration
16970 SECOND SERVANT By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with
16971 a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
16972 of him
16973 FIRST SERVANT What an arm he has He turn'd me about with his
16974 finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
16975 SECOND SERVANT Nay I knew by his face that there was something in
16976 him he had sir a kind of face methought I cannot tell how to
16977 term it
16978 FIRST SERVANT He had so looking as it were Would I were hang'd
16979 but I thought there was more in him than I could think
16980 SECOND SERVANT So did I I'll be sworn He is simply the rarest
16981 man i th world
16982 FIRST SERVANT I think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot
16983 on
16984 SECOND SERVANT Who my master
16985 FIRST SERVANT Nay it's no matter for that
16986 SECOND SERVANT Worth six on him
16987 FIRST SERVANT Nay not so neither but I take him to be the
16988 greater soldier
16989 SECOND SERVANT Faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
16990 for the defence of a town our general is excellent
16991 FIRST SERVANT Ay and for an assault too
16992 Reenter the third SERVINGMAN
16993 THIRD SERVANT O slaves I can tell you news news you rascals
16994 BOTH What what what Let's partake
16995 THIRD SERVANT I would not be a Roman of all nations
16996 I had as lief be a condemn'd man
16997 BOTH Wherefore wherefore
16998 THIRD SERVANT Why here's he that was wont to thwack our general
16999 Caius Marcius
17000 FIRST SERVANT Why do you say 'thwack our general'
17001 THIRD SERVANT I do not say 'thwack our general but he was always
17002 good enough for him
17003 SECOND SERVANT Come we are fellows and friends He was ever too
17004 hard for him I have heard him say so himself
17005 FIRST SERVANT He was too hard for him directly to say the troth
17006 on't before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a
17007 carbonado
17008 SECOND SERVANT An he had been cannibally given he might have
17009 broil'd and eaten him too
17010 FIRST SERVANT But more of thy news
17011 THIRD SERVANT Why he is so made on here within as if he were son
17012 and heir to Mars set at upper end o th table no question
17013 asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him
17014 Our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself
17015 with's hand and turns up the white o th eye to his discourse
17016 But the bottom of the news is our general is cut i th middle
17017 and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half
17018 by the entreaty and grant of the whole table He'll go he says
17019 and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th ears he will mow all
17020 down before him and leave his passage poll'd
17021 SECOND SERVANT And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine
17022 THIRD SERVANT Do't He will do't for look you sir he has as
17023 many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst
17024 not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends
17025 whilst he's in directitude
17026 FIRST SERVANT Directitude What's that
17027 THIRD SERVANT But when they shall see sir his crest up again and
17028 the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies
17029 after rain and revel an with him
17030 FIRST SERVANT But when goes this forward
17031 THIRD SERVANT Tomorrow today presently You shall have the
17032 drum struck up this afternoon 'tis as it were parcel of their
17033 feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips
17034 SECOND SERVANT Why then we shall have a stirring world again
17035 This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and
17036 breed balladmakers
17037 FIRST SERVANT Let me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as
17038 day does night it's spritely waking audible and full of vent
17039 Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mull'd deaf sleepy
17040 insensible a getter of more bastard children than war's a
17041 destroyer of men
17042 SECOND SERVANT 'Tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be
17043 a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
17044 cuckolds
17045 FIRST SERVANT Ay and it makes men hate one another
17046 THIRD SERVANT Reason because they then less need one another The
17047 wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians
17048 They are rising they are rising

17139 Join'd with Aufidius leads a power 'gainst Rome
17140 And vows revenge as spacious as between
17141 The young'st and oldest thing
17142 SICINIUS This is most likely
17143 BRUTUS Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish
17144 Good Marcius home again
17145 SICINIUS The very trick on 't
17146 MENENIUS This is unlikely
17147 He and Aufidius can no more atone
17148 Than violent'st contrariety
17149 Enter a second MESSENGER
17150 SECOND MESSENGER You are sent for to the Senate
17151 A fearful army led by Caius Marcius
17152 Associated with Aufidius rages
17153 Upon our territories and have already
17154 O'erborne their way consum'd with fire and took
17155 What lay before them
17156 Enter COMINIUS
17157 COMINIUS O you have made good work
17158 MENENIUS What news what news
17159 COMINIUS You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
17160 To melt the city leads upon your pates
17161 To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses
17162 MENENIUS What's the news What's the news
17163 COMINIUS Your temples burned in their cement and
17164 Your franchises whereon you stood confin'd
17165 Into an auger's bore
17166 MENENIUS Pray now your news
17167 You have made fair work I fear me Pray your news
17168 If Marcius should be join'd wi th Volscians
17169 COMINIUS If
17170 He is their god he leads them like a thing
17171 Made by some other deity than Nature
17172 That shapes man better and they follow him
17173 Against us brats with no less confidence
17174 Than boys pursuing summer butterflies
17175 Or butchers killing flies
17176 MENENIUS You have made good work
17177 You and your apron men you that stood so much
17178 Upon the voice of occupation and
17179 The breath of garliceaters
17180 COMINIUS He'll shake
17181 Your Rome about your ears
17182 MENENIUS As Hercules
17183 Did shake down mellow fruit You have made fair work
17184 BRUTUS But is this true sir
17185 COMINIUS Ay and you'll look pale
17186 Before you find it other All the regions
17187 Do smilingly revolt and who resists
17188 Are mock'd for valiant ignorance
17189 And perish constant fools Who is't can blame him
17190 Your enemies and his find something in him
17191 MENENIUS We are all undone unless
17192 The noble man have mercy
17193 COMINIUS Who shall ask it
17194 The tribunes cannot do't for shame the people
17195 Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
17196 Does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
17197 Should say 'Be good to Rome they charg'd him even
17198 As those should do that had deserv'd his hate
17199 And therein show'd fike enemies
17200 MENENIUS 'Tis true
17201 If he were putting to my house the brand
17202 That should consume it I have not the face
17203 To say 'Beseech you cease You have made fair hands
17204 You and your crafts You have crafted fair
17205 COMINIUS You have brought
17206 A trembling upon Rome such as was never
17207 S incapable of help
17208 BOTH TRIBUNES Say not we brought it
17209 MENENIUS How Was't we We lov'd him but like beasts
17210 And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
17211 Who did hoot him out o th city
17212 COMINIUS But I fear
17213 They'll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius
17214 The second name of men obeys his points
17215 As if he were his officer Desperation
17216 Is all the policy strength and defence
17217 That Rome can make against them
17218 Enter a troop of citizens
17219 MENENIUS Here comes the clusters
17220 And is Aufidius with him You are they
17221 That made the air unwholesome when you cast
17222 Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
17223 Coriolanus exile Now he's coming
17224 And not a hair upon a soldier's head
17225 Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
17226 As you threw caps up will he tumble down
17227 And pay you for your voices 'Tis no matter
17228 If he could burn us all into one coal
17229 We have deserv'd it
17230 PLEBEIANS Faith we hear fearful news
17231 FIRST CITIZEN For mine own part
17232 When I said banish him I said 'twas pity
17233 SECOND CITIZEN And so did I
17234 THIRD CITIZEN And so did I and to say the truth so did very
17235 many of us That we did we did for the best and though we
17236 willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our
17237 will
17238 COMINIUS Y'are goodly things you voices
17239 MENENIUS You have made
17240 Good work you and your cry Shall's to the Capitol
17241 COMINIUS O ay what else
17242 Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
17243 SICINIUS Go masters get you be not dismay'd
17244 These are a side that would be glad to have
17245 This true which they so seem to fear Go home
17246 And show no sign of fear
17247 FIRST CITIZEN The gods be good to us Come masters let's home I
17248 ever said we were i th wrong when we banish'd him
17249 SECOND CITIZEN So did we all But come let's home
17250 Exeunt citizens
17251 BRUTUS I do not like this news
17252 SICINIUS Nor I
17253 BRUTUS Let's to the Capitol Would half my wealth
17254 Would buy this for a lie
17255 SICINIUS Pray let's go Exeunt
17256 SCENE VII
17257 A camp at a short distance from Rome
17258 Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT
17259 AUFIDIUS Do they still fly to th Roman
17260 LIEUTENANT I do not know what witchcraft's in him but
17261 Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
17262 Their talk at table and their thanks at end
17263 And you are dark'ned in this action sir
17264 Even by your own
17265 AUFIDIUS I cannot help it now
17266 Unless by using means I lame the foot
17267 Of our design He bears himself more proudlier
17268 Even to my person than I thought he would
17269 When first I did embrace him yet his nature
17270 In that's no changeling and I must excuse
17271 What cannot be amended
17272 LIEUTENANT Yet I wish sir
17273 I mean for your particular you had not
17274 Join'd in commission with him but either
17275 Had borne the action of yourself or else
17276 To him had left it solely
17277 AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure
17278 When he shall come to his account he knows not
17279 What I can urge against him Although it seems
17280 And so he thinks and is no less apparent
17281 To th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
17282 And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state
17283 Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
17284 As draw his sword yet he hath left undone
17285 That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
17286 Whene'er we come to our account
17287 LIEUTENANT Sir I beseech you think you he'll carry Rome
17288 AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down
17289 And the nobility of Rome are his
17290 The senators and patricians love him too
17291 The tribunes are no soldiers and their people
17292 Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
17293 To expel him thence I think he'll be to Rome
17294 As is the osprey to the fish who takes it
17295 By sovereignty of nature First he was
17296 A noble servant to them but he could not
17297 Carry his honours even Whether 'twas pride
17298 Which out of daily fortune ever taints
17299 The happy man whether defect of judgment
17300 To fail in the disposing of those chances
17301 Which he was lord of or whether nature
17302 Not to be other than one thing not moving
17303 From th casque to th cushion but commanding peace
17304 Even with the same austerity and garb
17305 As he controll'd the war but one of these
17306 As he hath spices of them all not all
17307 For I dare so far free him made him fear'd
17308 So hated and so banish'd But he has a merit
17309 To choke it in the utt'rance So our virtues
17310 Lie in th interpretation of the time
17311 And power unto itself most commendable
17312 Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
17313 T extol what it hath done
17314 One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
17315 Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
17316 Come let's away When Caius Rome is thine
17317 Thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine
17318 Exeunt

17327 ACT V SCENE I
17328 Rome A public place
17329 Enter MENENIUS COMINIUS SICINIUS and BRUTUS the two Tribunes with others
17330 MENENIUS No I'll not go You hear what he hath said
17331 Which was sometime his general who lov'd him
17332 In a most dear particular He call'd me father
17333 But what o that Go you that banish'd him
17334 A mile before his tent fall down and knee
17335 The way into his mercy Nay if he coy'd
17336 To hear Cominius speak I'll keep at home
17337 COMINIUS He would not seem to know me
17338 MENENIUS Do you hear
17339 COMINIUS Yet one time he did call me by my name
17340 I urg'd our old acquaintance and the drops
17341 That we have bled together 'Coriolanus'
17342 He would not answer to forbid all names
17343 He was a kind of nothing titleless
17344 Till he had forg'd himself a name i th fire
17345 Of burning Rome
17346 MENENIUS Why so You have made good work
17347 A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
17348 To make coals cheap a noble memory
17349 COMINIUS I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
17350 When it was less expected he replied
17351 It was a bare petition of a state
17352 To one whom they had punish'd
17353 MENENIUS Very well
17354 Could he say less
17355 COMINIUS I offer'd to awaken his regard
17356 For's private friends his answer to me was
17357 He could not stay to pick them in a pile
17358 Of noisome musty chaff He said 'twas folly
17359 For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
17360 And still to nose th offence
17361 MENENIUS For one poor grain or two
17362 I am one of those His mother wife his child
17363 And this brave fellow too we are the grains
17364 You are the musty chaff and you are smelt
17365 Above the moon We must be burnt for you
17366 SICINIUS Nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
17367 In this so neverneeded help yet do not
17368 Upbraid's with our distress But sure if you
17369 Would be your country's pleader your good tongue
17370 More than the instant army we can make
17371 Might stop our countryman
17372 MENENIUS No I'll not meddle
17373 SICINIUS Pray you go to him
17374 MENENIUS What should I do
17375 BRUTUS Only make trial what your love can do
17376 For Rome towards Marcius
17377 MENENIUS Well and say that Marcius
17378 Return me as Cominius is return'd
17379 Unheard what then
17380 But as a discontented friend griefshot
17381 With his unkindness Say't be so
17382 SICINIUS Yet your good will
17383 Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
17384 As you intended well
17385 MENENIUS I'll undertake't
17386 I think he'll hear me Yet to bite his lip
17387 And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me
17388 He was not taken well he had not din'd
17389 The veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then
17390 We pout upon the morning are unapt
17391 To give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd
17392 These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
17393 With wine and feeding we have suppler souls
17394 Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore I'll watch him
17395 Till he be dieted to my request
17396 And then I'll set upon him
17397 BRUTUS You know the very road into his kindness
17398 And cannot lose your way
17399 MENENIUS Good faith I'll prove him
17400 Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge
17401 Of my success Exit
17402 COMINIUS He'll never hear him
17403 SICINIUS Not
17404 COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye
17405 Red as 'twould burn Rome and his injury
17406 The gaoler to his pity I kneel'd before him
17407 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise dismiss'd me
17408 Thus with his speechless hand What he would do
17409 He sent in writing after me what he would not
17410 Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
17411 So that all hope is vain
17412 Unless his noble mother and his wife
17413 Who as I hear mean to solicit him
17414 For mercy to his country Therefore let's hence
17415 And with our fair entreaties haste them on Exeunt

17464 virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied
17465 intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be Can you

17534 You have respected stopp'd your ears against
17535 The general suit of Rome never admitted
17536 A private whisper no not with such friends
17537 That thought them sure of you
17538 CORIOLANUS This last old man
17539 Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome
17540 Lov'd me above the measure of a father
17541 Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge
17542 Was to send him for whose old love I have
17543 Though I show'd sourly to him once more offer'd
17544 The first conditions which they did refuse
17545 And cannot now accept To grace him only
17546 That thought he could do more a very little
17547 I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
17548 Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
17549 Will I lend ear to [Shout within] Ha what shout is this
17550 Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow

17552 Enter in mourning habits VIRGILIA VOLUMNIA VALERIA
17553 YOUNG MARCIUS with attendants
17554 My wife comes foremost then the honour'd mould
17555 Wherein this trunk was fram'd and in her hand
17556 The grandchild to her blood But out affection
17557 All bond and privilege of nature break
17558 Let it be virtuous to be obstinate
17559 What is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes
17560 Which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not
17561 Of stronger earth than others My mother bows
17562 As if Olympus to a molehill should
17563 In supplication nod and my young boy
17564 Hath an aspect of intercession which
17565 Great nature cries 'Deny not Let the Volsces
17566 Plough Rome and harrow Italy I'll never
17567 Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
17568 As if a man were author of himself
17569 And knew no other kin
17570 VIRGILIA My lord and husband
17571 CORIOLANUS These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome
17572 VIRGILIA The sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd
17573 Makes you think so
17574 CORIOLANUS Like a dull actor now
17575 I have forgot my part and I am out
17576 Even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh
17577 Forgive my tyranny but do not say
17578 For that 'Forgive our Romans O a kiss
17579 Long as my exile sweet as my revenge
17580 Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
17581 I carried from thee dear and my true lip
17582 Hath virgin'd it e'er since You gods I prate
17583 And the most noble mother of the world
17584 Leave unsaluted Sink my knee i th earth [Kneels]
17585 Of thy deep duty more impression show
17586 Than that of common sons
17587 VOLUMNIA O stand up blest
17588 Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
17589 I kneel before thee and unproperly
17590 Show duty as mistaken all this while
17591 Between the child and parent [Kneels]
17592 CORIOLANUS What's this
17593 Your knees to me to your corrected son
17594 Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
17595 Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
17596 Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun
17597 Murd'ring impossibility to make
17598 What cannot be slight work
17599 VOLUMNIA Thou art my warrior
17600 I holp to frame thee Do you know this lady
17601 CORIOLANUS The noble sister of Publicola
17602 The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle
17603 That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
17604 And hangs on Dian's temple dear Valeria
17605 VOLUMNIA This is a poor epitome of yours
17606 Which by th interpretation of full time
17607 May show like all yourself
17608 CORIOLANUS The god of soldiers
17609 With the consent of supreme Jove inform
17610 Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
17611 To shame unvulnerable and stick i th wars

17617 Are suitors to you
17618 CORIOLANUS I beseech you peace
17619 Or if you'd ask remember this before
17620 The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
17621 Be held by you denials Do not bid me
17622 Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
17623 Again with Rome's mechanics Tell me not
17624 Wherein I seem unnatural desire not
17625 T'allay my rages and revenges with
17626 Your colder reasons
17627 VOLUMNIA O no more no more
17628 You have said you will not grant us any thing
17629 For we have nothing else to ask but that
17630 Which you deny already yet we will ask
17631 That if you fail in our request the blame
17632 May hang upon your hardness therefore hear us
17633 CORIOLANUS Aufidius and you Volsces mark for we'll
17634 Hear nought from Rome in private Your request
17635 VOLUMNIA Should we be silent and not speak our raiment
17636 And state of bodies would bewray what life
17637 We have led since thy exile Think with thyself
17638 How more unfortunate than all living women
17639 Are we come hither since that thy sight which should
17640 Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts
17641 Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
17642 Making the mother wife and child to see
17643 The son the husband and the father tearing
17644 His country's bowels out And to poor we
17645 Thine enmity's most capital thou bar'st us
17646 Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
17647 That all but we enjoy For how can we
17648 Alas how can we for our country pray
17649 Whereto we are bound together with thy victory
17650 Whereto we are bound Alack or we must lose
17651 The country our dear nurse or else thy person
17652 Our comfort in the country We must find
17653 An evident calamity though we had
17654 Our wish which side should win for either thou
17655 Must as a foreign recreant be led
17656 With manacles through our streets or else
17657 Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin
17658 And bear the palm for having bravely shed
17659 Thy wife and children's blood For myself son
17660 I purpose not to wait on fortune till
17661 These wars determine if I can not persuade thee
17662 Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
17663 Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
17664 March to assault thy country than to tread
17665 Trust to't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb
17666 That brought thee to this world
17667 VIRGILIA Ay and mine
17668 That brought you forth this boy to keep your name
17669 Living to time
17670 BOY 'A shall not tread on me
17671 I'll run away till I am bigger but then I'll fight
17672 CORIOLANUS Not of a woman's tenderness to be
17673 Requires nor child nor woman's face to see
17674 I have sat too long [Rising]
17675 VOLUMNIA Nay go not from us thus
17676 If it were so that our request did tend
17677 To save the Romans thereby to destroy
17678 The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
17679 As poisonous of your honour No our suit
17680 Is that you reconcile them while the Volsces
17681 May say 'This mercy we have show'd the Romans
17682 'This we receiv'd and each in either side
17683 Give the allhail to thee and cry 'Be blest
17684 For making up this peace Thou know'st great son
17685 The end of war's uncertain but this certain
17686 That if thou conquer Rome the benefit
17687 Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
17688 Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses
17689 Whose chronicle thus writ 'The man was noble
17690 But with his last attempt he wip'd it out
17691 Destroy'd his country and his name remains
17692 To th ensuing age abhorr'd Speak to me son
17693 Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
17694 To imitate the graces of the gods
17695 To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o th air
17696 And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
17697 That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak
17698 Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
17699 Still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you
17700 He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy
17701 Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
17702 Than can our reasons There's no man in the world
17703 More bound to's mother yet here he lets me prate
17704 Like one i th stocks Thou hast never in thy life
17705 Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy
17706 When she poor hen fond of no second brood
17707 Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home
17708 Loaden with honour Say my request's unjust
17709 And spurn me back but if it he not so
17710 Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
17711 That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
17712 To a mother's part belongs He turns away
17713 Down ladies let us shame him with our knees
17714 To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
17715 Than pity to our prayers Down An end
17716 This is the last So we will home to Rome
17717 And die among our neighbours Nay behold's
17718 This boy that cannot tell what he would have
17719 But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship
17720 Does reason our petition with more strength
17721 Than thou hast to deny't Come let us go
17722 This fellow had a Volscian to his mother
17723 His wife is in Corioli and his child
17724 Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch
17725 I am hush'd until our city be afire
17726 And then I'll speak a little
17727 [He holds her by the hand silent]
17728 CORIOLANUS O mother mother
17729 What have you done Behold the heavens do ope
17730 The gods look down and this unnatural scene
17731 They laugh at O my mother mother O
17732 You have won a happy victory to Rome
17733 But for your son believe it O believe it
17734 Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd
17735 If not most mortal to him But let it come
17736 Aufidius though I cannot make true wars
17737 I'll frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius
17738 Were you in my stead would you have heard
17739 A mother less or granted less Aufidius
17740 AUFIDIUS I was mov'd withal
17741 CORIOLANUS I dare be sworn you were
17742 And sir it is no little thing to make
17743 Mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir
17744 What peace you'fl make advise me For my part
17745 I'll not to Rome I'll back with you and pray you
17746 Stand to me in this cause O mother wife
17747 AUFIDIUS [Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy
17748 honour
17749 At difference in thee Out of that I'll work
17750 Myself a former fortune
17751 CORIOLANUS [To the ladies] Ay by and by
17752 But we will drink together and you shall bear
17753 A better witness back than words which we
17754 On like conditions will have counterseal'd
17755 Come enter with us Ladies you deserve

17763 SICINIUS Why what of that
17764 MENENIUS If it be possible for you to displace it with your little
17765 finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome especially his
17766 mother may prevail with him But I say there is no hope in't
17767 our throats are sentenc'd and stay upon execution
17768 SICINIUS Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
17769 condition of a man
17770 MENENIUS There is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet
17771 your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown from man to
17772 dragon he has wings he's more than a creeping thing
17773 SICINIUS He lov'd his mother dearly
17774 MENENIUS So did he me and he no more remembers his mother now
17775 than an eightyearold horse The tartness of his face sours ripe
17776 grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground
17777 shrinks before his treading He is able to pierce a corslet with
17778 his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery He sits in
17779 his state as a thing made for Alexander What he bids be done is
17780 finish'd with his bidding He wants nothing of a god but
17781 eternity and a heaven to throne in
17782 SICINIUS Yes mercy if you report him truly
17783 MENENIUS I paint him in the character Mark what mercy his mother
17784 shall bring from him There is no more mercy in him than there is
17785 milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find And all this
17786 is 'long of you
17787 SICINIUS The gods be good unto us
17788 MENENIUS No in such a case the gods will not be good unto us
17789 When we banish'd him we respected not them and he returning to
17790 break our necks they respect not us
17791 Enter a MESSENGER

17850 To purge himself with words Dispatch
17851 Exeunt attendants
17852 Enter three or four CONSPIRATORS of AUFIDIUS faction
17853 Most welcome
17854 FIRST CONSPIRATOR How is it with our general
17855 AUFIDIUS Even so
17856 As with a man by his own alms empoison'd
17857 And with his charity slain
17858 SECOND CONSPIRATOR Most noble sir
17859 If you do hold the same intent wherein
17860 You wish'd us parties we'll deliver you
17861 Of your great danger
17862 AUFIDIUS Sir I cannot tell
17863 We must proceed as we do find the people
17864 THIRD CONSPIRATOR The people will remain uncertain whilst
17865 'Twixt you there's difference but the fall of either
17866 Makes the survivor heir of all
17867 AUFIDIUS I know it
17868 And my pretext to strike at him admits
17869 A good construction I rais'd him and I pawn'd
17870 Mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd
17871 He watered his new plants with dews of flattery
17872 Seducing so my friends and to this end
17873 He bow'd his nature never known before
17874 But to be rough unswayable and free
17875 THIRD CONSPIRATOR Sir his stoutness
17876 When he did stand for consul which he lost
17877 By lack of stooping
17878 AUFIDIUS That I would have spoken of
17879 Being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth
17880 Presented to my knife his throat I took him
17881 Made him jointservant with me gave him way
17882 In all his own desires nay let him choose
17883 Out of my files his projects to accomplish
17884 My best and freshest men serv'd his designments
17885 In mine own person holp to reap the fame
17886 Which he did end all his and took some pride
17887 To do myself this wrong Till at the last
17888 I seem'd his follower not partner and
17889 He wag'd me with his countenance as if
17890 I had been mercenary
17891 FIRST CONSPIRATOR So he did my lord
17892 The army marvell'd at it and in the last
17893 When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
17894 For no less spoil than glory
17895 AUFIDIUS There was it
17896 For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him
17897 At a few drops of women's rheum which are
17898 As cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
17899 Of our great action therefore shall he die
17900 And I'll renew me in his fall But hark
17901 [Drums and
17902 trumpets sound with great shouts of the people]
17903 FIRST CONSPIRATOR Your native town you enter'd like a post
17904 And had no welcomes home but he returns
17905 Splitting the air with noise

17907 Whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
17908 With giving him glory
17909 THIRD CONSPIRATOR Therefore at your vantage
17910 Ere he express himself or move the people
17911 With what he would say let him feel your sword
17912 Which we will second When he lies along
17913 After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
17914 His reasons with his body

17925 Might have found easy fines but there to end
17926 Where he was to begin and give away
17927 The benefit of our levies answering us
17928 With our own charge making a treaty where
17929 There was a yielding this admits no excuse
17930 AUFIDIUS He approaches you shall hear him

17932 the commoners being with him
17933 CORIOLANUS Hail lords I am return'd your soldier
17934 No more infected with my country's love
17935 Than when I parted hence but still subsisting

17937 That prosperously I have attempted and
17938 With bloody passage led your wars even to
17939 The gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home
17940 Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
17941 The charges of the action We have made peace
17942 With no less honour to the Antiates
17943 Than shame to th Romans and we here deliver
17944 Subscrib'd by th consuls and patricians
17945 Together with the seal o th Senate what
17946 We have compounded on
17947 AUFIDIUS Read it not noble lords
17948 But tell the traitor in the highest degree
17949 He hath abus'd your powers
17950 CORIOLANUS Traitor How now
17951 AUFIDIUS Ay traitor Marcius

17957 He has betray'd your business and given up
17958 For certain drops of salt your city Rome
17959 I say your city to his wife and mother
17960 Breaking his oath and resolution like
17961 A twist of rotten silk never admitting
17962 Counsel o th war but at his nurse's tears
17963 He whin'd and roar'd away your victory
17964 That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
17965 Look'd wond'ring each at others

17973 I was forc'd to scold Your judgments my grave lords

17979 CORIOLANUS Cut me to pieces Volsces men and lads
17980 Stain all your edges on me 'Boy False hound
17981 If you have writ your annals true 'tis there
17982 That like an eagle in a dovecote I
17983 Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli
17984 Alone I did it 'Boy'
17985 AUFIDIUS Why noble lords
17986 Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune

18093 Is outward sorrow though I think the King
18094 Be touch'd at very heart
18095 SECOND GENTLEMAN None but the King
18096 FIRST GENTLEMAN He that hath lost her too So is the Queen
18097 That most desir'd the match But not a courtier
18098 Although they wear their faces to the bent
18099 Of the King's looks hath a heart that is not
18100 Glad at the thing they scowl at
18101 SECOND GENTLEMAN And why so
18102 FIRST GENTLEMAN He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing
18103 Too bad for bad report and he that hath her
18104 I mean that married her alack good man
18105 And therefore banish'd is a creature such
18106 As to seek through the regions of the earth
18107 For one his like there would be something failing
18108 In him that should compare I do not think
18109 So fair an outward and such stuff within
18110 Endows a man but he
18111 SECOND GENTLEMAN You speak him far
18112 FIRST GENTLEMAN I do extend him sir within himself
18113 Crush him together rather than unfold
18114 His measure duly
18115 SECOND GENTLEMAN What's his name and birth
18116 FIRST GENTLEMAN I cannot delve him to the root his father
18117 Was call'd Sicilius who did join his honour
18118 Against the Romans with Cassibelan
18119 But had his titles by Tenantius whom
18120 He serv'd with glory and admir'd success
18121 So gain'd the suraddition Leonatus
18122 And had besides this gentleman in question
18123 Two other sons who in the wars o th time
18124 Died with their swords in hand for which their father
18125 Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
18126 That he quit being and his gentle lady
18127 Big of this gentleman our theme deceas'd
18128 As he was born The King he takes the babe
18129 To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus
18130 Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber
18131 Puts to him all the learnings that his time
18132 Could make him the receiver of which he took
18133 As we do air fast as 'twas minist'red
18134 And in's spring became a harvest liv'd in court
18135 Which rare it is to do most prais'd most lov'd
18136 A sample to the youngest to th more mature
18137 A glass that feated them and to the graver
18138 A child that guided dotards To his mistress
18139 For whom he now is banish'd her own price
18140 Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue
18141 By her election may be truly read
18142 What kind of man he is
18143 SECOND GENTLEMAN I honour him
18144 Even out of your report But pray you tell me
18145 Is she sole child to th King
18146 FIRST GENTLEMAN His only child
18147 He had two sons if this be worth your hearing
18148 Mark it the eldest of them at three years old
18149 I th swathing clothes the other from their nursery
18150 Were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge
18151 Which way they went
18152 SECOND GENTLEMAN How long is this ago
18153 FIRST GENTLEMAN Some twenty years
18154 SECOND GENTLEMAN That a king's children should be so convey'd
18155 So slackly guarded and the search so slow
18156 That could not trace them
18157 FIRST GENTLEMAN Howsoe'er 'tis strange
18158 Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at
18159 Yet is it true sir
18160 SECOND GENTLEMAN I do well believe you

18308 FIRST LORD Sir I would advise you to shift a shirt the violence
18309 of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice Where air comes out
18310 air comes in there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent
18311 CLOTEN If my shirt were bloody then to shift it Have I hurt him
18312 SECOND LORD [Aside] No faith not so much as his patience
18313 FIRST LORD Hurt him His body's a passable carcass if he be not
18314 hurt It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt
18315 SECOND LORD [Aside] His steel was in debt it went o th back
18316 side the town
18317 CLOTEN The villain would not stand me
18318 SECOND LORD [Aside] No but he fled forward still toward your
18319 face
18320 FIRST LORD Stand you You have land enough of your own but he
18321 added to your having gave you some ground
18322 SECOND LORD [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans
18323 Puppies
18324 CLOTEN I would they had not come between us
18325 SECOND LORD [Aside] So would I till you had measur'd how long a
18326 fool you were upon the ground
18327 CLOTEN And that she should love this fellow and refuse me
18328 SECOND LORD [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election she is
18329 damn'd
18330 FIRST LORD Sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain go
18331 not together she's a good sign but I have seen small reflection
18332 of her wit
18333 SECOND LORD [Aside] She shines not upon fools lest the reflection
18334 should hurt her
18335 CLOTEN Come I'll to my chamber Would there had been some hurt
18336 done
18337 SECOND LORD [Aside] I wish not so unless it had been the fall of
18338 an ass which is no great hurt

18346 IMOGEN I would thou grew'st unto the shores o th haven
18347 And questioned'st every sail if he should write
18348 And I not have it 'twere a paper lost
18349 As offer'd mercy is What was the last
18350 That he spake to thee
18351 PISANIO It was his queen his queen
18352 IMOGEN Then wav'd his handkerchief
18353 PISANIO And kiss'd it madam
18354 IMOGEN Senseless linen happier therein than I
18355 And that was all
18356 PISANIO No madam for so long
18357 As he could make me with his eye or care
18358 Distinguish him from others he did keep
18359 The deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
18360 Still waving as the fits and stirs of's mind
18361 Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on
18362 How swift his ship
18363 IMOGEN Thou shouldst have made him
18364 As little as a crow or less ere left
18365 To aftereye him
18366 PISANIO Madam so I did
18367 IMOGEN I would have broke mine eyestrings crack'd them but
18368 To look upon him till the diminution
18369 Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
18370 Nay followed him till he had melted from
18371 The smallness of a gnat to air and then
18372 Have turn'd mine eye and wept But good Pisanio
18373 When shall we hear from him
18374 PISANIO Be assur'd madam
18375 With his next vantage
18376 IMOGEN I did not take my leave of him but had
18377 Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him
18378 How I would think on him at certain hours
18379 Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear
18380 The shes of Italy should not betray
18381 Mine interest and his honour or have charg'd him
18382 At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
18383 T encounter me with orisons for then
18384 I am in heaven for him or ere I could
18385 Give him that parting kiss which I had set

18395 SCENE IV
18396 Rome PHILARIO'S house
18397 Enter PHILARIO IACHIMO a FRENCHMAN a DUTCHMAN and a SPANIARD
18398 IACHIMO Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain He was then
18399 of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
18400 been allowed the name of But I could then have look'd on him
18401 without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his
18402 endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by
18403 items
18404 PHILARIO You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
18405 is with that which makes him both without and within
18406 FRENCHMAN I have seen him in France we had very many there could
18407 behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
18408 IACHIMO This matter of marrying his king's daughter wherein he
18409 must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I
18410 doubt not a great deal from the matter
18411 FRENCHMAN And then his banishment
18412 IACHIMO Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
18413 divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it
18414 but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay
18415 flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it
18416 he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance
18417 PHILARIO His father and I were soldiers together to whom I have
18418 been often bound for no less than my life
18419 Enter POSTHUMUS
18420 Here comes the Briton Let him be so entertained amongst you as
18421 suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
18422 quality I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman
18423 whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine How worthy he is
18424 I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his
18425 own hearing
18426 FRENCHMAN Sir we have known together in Orleans
18427 POSTHUMUS Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies
18428 which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still
18429 FRENCHMAN Sir you o'errate my poor kindness I was glad I did
18430 atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have
18431 been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore
18432 upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature
18433 POSTHUMUS By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller
18434 rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every
18435 action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended
18436 judgment if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not
18437 altogether slight
18438 FRENCHMAN Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and
18439 by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the
18440 other or have fall'n both
18441 IACHIMO Can we with manners ask what was the difference
18442 FRENCHMAN Safely I think 'Twas a contention in public which
18443 may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like
18444 an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in
18445 praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time
18446 vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more
18447 fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less
18448 attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France
18449 IACHIMO That lady is not now living or this gentleman's opinion
18450 by this worn out
18451 POSTHUMUS She holds her virtue still and I my mind
18452 IACHIMO You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy
18453 POSTHUMUS Being so far provok'd as I was in France I would abate
18454 her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend
18455 IACHIMO As fair and as good a kind of handinhand comparison
18456 had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain
18457 If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours
18458 outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she
18459 excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that
18460 is nor you the lady
18461 POSTHUMUS I prais'd her as I rated her So do I my stone
18462 IACHIMO What do you esteem it at
18463 POSTHUMUS More than the world enjoys
18464 IACHIMO Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead or she's
18465 outpriz'd by a trifle
18466 POSTHUMUS You are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there
18467 were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the
18468 other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods
18469 IACHIMO Which the gods have given you
18470 POSTHUMUS Which by their graces I will keep
18471 IACHIMO You may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl
18472 light upon neighbouring ponds Your ring may be stol'n too So
18473 your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and
18474 the other casual a cunning thief or a thatwayaccomplish'd
18475 courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
18476 POSTHUMUS Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to
18477 convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of
18478 that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of
18479 thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ring
18480 PHILARIO Let us leave here gentlemen
18481 POSTHUMUS Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank
18482 him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
18483 IACHIMO With five times so much conversation I should get ground
18484 of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had
18485 I admittance and opportunity to friend
18486 POSTHUMUS No no
18487 IACHIMO I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
18488 ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something But I make
18489 my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and
18490 to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any
18491 lady in the world
18492 POSTHUMUS You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion
18493 and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt
18494 IACHIMO What's that
18495 POSTHUMUS A repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve
18496 more a punishment too
18497 PHILARIO Gentlemen enough of this It came in too suddenly let
18498 it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted
18499 IACHIMO Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on th'
18500 approbation of what I have spoke
18501 POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail
18502 IACHIMO Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will
18503 lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the
18504 court where your lady is with no more advantage than the
18505 opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence
18506 that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd
18507 POSTHUMUS I will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I
18508 hold dear as my finger 'tis part of it
18509 IACHIMO You are a friend and therein the wiser If you buy
18510 ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from
18511 tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fear
18512 POSTHUMUS This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver
18513 purpose I hope
18514 IACHIMO I am the master of my speeches and would undergo what's
18515 spoken I swear
18516 POSTHUMUS Will you I Shall but lend my diamond till your return
18517 Let there be covenants drawn between's My mistress exceeds in
18518 goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to
18519 this match here's my ring
18520 PHILARIO I will have it no lay
18521 IACHIMO By the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient
18522 testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your
18523 mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond
18524 too If I come off and leave her in such honour as you have
18525 trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours
18526 provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment
18527 POSTHUMUS I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt
18528 us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon
18529 her and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd I am
18530 no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain
18531 unseduc'd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill
18532 opinion and th assault you have made to her chastity you shall
18533 answer me with your sword
18534 IACHIMO Your hand a covenant We will have these things set down
18535 by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the
18536 bargain should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold and
18537 have our two wagers recorded
18538 POSTHUMUS Agreed Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO
18539 FRENCHMAN Will this hold think you
18540 PHILARIO Signior Iachimo will not from it Pray let us follow 'em

18561 That our great king himself doth woo me oft
18562 For my confections Having thus far proceeded
18563 Unless thou think'st me devilish is't not meet
18564 That I did amplify my judgment in
18565 Other conclusions I will try the forces
18566 Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
18567 We count not worth the hanging but none human
18568 To try the vigour of them and apply
18569 Allayments to their act and by them gather
18570 Their several virtues and effects
18571 CORNELIUS Your Highness
18572 Shall from this practice but make hard your heart
18573 Besides the seeing these effects will be
18574 Both noisome and infectious
18575 QUEEN O content thee
18576 Enter PISANIO
18577 [Aside] Here comes a flattering rascal upon him
18578 Will I first work He's for his master
18579 An enemy to my son How now Pisanio
18580 Doctor your service for this time is ended
18581 Take your own way
18582 CORNELIUS [Aside] I do suspect you madam
18583 But you shall do no harm
18584 QUEEN [To PISANIO] Hark thee a word
18585 CORNELIUS [Aside] I do not like her She doth think she has
18586 Strange ling'ring poisons I do know her spirit
18587 And will not trust one of her malice with
18588 A drug of such damn'd nature Those she has
18589 Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
18590 Which first perchance she'll prove on cats and dogs
18591 Then afterward up higher but there is
18592 No danger in what show of death it makes
18593 More than the locking up the spirits a time
18594 To be more fresh reviving She is fool'd
18595 With a most false effect and I the truer
18596 So to be false with her
18597 QUEEN No further service Doctor
18598 Until I send for thee
18599 CORNELIUS I humbly take my leave Exit
18600 QUEEN Weeps she still say'st thou Dost thou think in time
18601 She will not quench and let instructions enter
18602 Where folly now possesses Do thou work
18603 When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
18604 I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
18605 As great as is thy master greater for
18606 His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
18607 Is at last gasp Return he cannot nor
18608 Continue where he is To shift his being
18609 Is to exchange one misery with another
18610 And every day that comes comes comes to
18611 A day's work in him What shalt thou expect
18612 To be depender on a thing that leans
18613 Who cannot be new built nor has no friends
18614 So much as but to prop him
18615 [The QUEEN drops the box PISANIO takes it up]
18616 Thou tak'st up
18617 Thou know'st not what but take it for thy labour
18618 It is a thing I made which hath the King
18619 Five times redeem'd from death I do not know
18620 What is more cordial Nay I prithee take it
18621 It is an earnest of a further good
18622 That I mean to thee Tell thy mistress how
18623 The case stands with her do't as from thyself
18624 Think what a chance thou changest on but think
18625 Thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
18626 Who shall take notice of thee I'll move the King
18627 To any shape of thy preferment such
18628 As thou'lt desire and then myself I chiefly
18629 That set thee on to this desert am bound
18630 To load thy merit richly Call my women
18631 Think on my words Exit PISANIO
18632 A sly and constant knave
18633 Not to be shak'd the agent for his master
18634 And the remembrancer of her to hold
18635 The handfast to her lord I have given him that
18636 Which if he take shall quite unpeople her
18637 Of leigers for her sweet and which she after
18638 Except she bend her humour shall be assur'd
18639 To taste of too
18640 Reenter PISANIO and LADIES

18643 Bear to my closet Fare thee well Pisanio
18644 Think on my words Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES

18676 kindnesses I am most infinitely tied Reflect upon him
18677 accordingly as you value your trust LEONATUS'

18681 You are as welcome worthy sir as I
18682 Have words to bid you and shall find it so
18683 In all that I can do
18684 IACHIMO Thanks fairest lady
18685 What are men mad Hath nature given them eyes
18686 To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
18687 Of sea and land which can distinguish 'twixt
18688 The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
18689 Upon the number'd beach and can we not
18690 Partition make with spectacles so precious
18691 'Twixt fair and foul

18694 'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
18695 Contemn with mows the other nor i th judgment
18696 For idiots in this case of favour would
18697 Be wisely definite nor i th appetite
18698 Sluttery to such neat excellence oppos'd
18699 Should make desire vomit emptiness
18700 Not so allur'd to feed
18701 IMOGEN What is the matter trow
18702 IACHIMO The cloyed will
18703 That satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub

18718 The Britain reveller
18719 IMOGEN When he was here
18720 He did incline to sadness and ofttimes
18721 Not knowing why
18722 IACHIMO I never saw him sad
18723 There is a Frenchman his companion one
18724 An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
18725 A Gallian girl at home He furnaces
18726 The thick sighs from him whiles the jolly Briton
18727 Your lord I mean laughs from's free lungs cries 'O
18728 Can my sides hold to think that man who knows
18729 By history report or his own proof
18730 What woman is yea what she cannot choose

18732 Assured bondage'
18733 IMOGEN Will my lord say so
18734 IACHIMO Ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
18735 It is a recreation to be by
18736 And hear him mock the Frenchman But heavens know
18737 Some men are much to blame
18738 IMOGEN Not he I hope
18739 IACHIMO Not he but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
18740 Be us'd more thankfully In himself 'tis much
18741 In you which I account his beyond all talents
18742 Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound
18743 To pity too
18744 IMOGEN What do you pity sir
18745 IACHIMO Two creatures heartily

18751 I th dungeon by a snuff
18752 IMOGEN I pray you sir
18753 Deliver with more openness your answers
18754 To my demands Why do you pity me
18755 IACHIMO That others do
18756 I was about to say enjoy your But
18757 It is an office of the gods to venge it
18758 Not mine to speak on't
18759 IMOGEN You do seem to know
18760 Something of me or what concerns me pray you
18761 Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
18762 Than to be sure they do for certainties
18763 Either are past remedies or timely knowing
18764 The remedy then born discover to me
18765 What both you spur and stop
18766 IACHIMO Had I this cheek
18767 To bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
18768 Whose every touch would force the feeler's soul
18769 To th oath of loyalty this object which
18770 Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
18771 Fixing it only here should I damn'd then
18772 Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
18773 That mount the Capitol join gripes with hands
18774 Made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood as
18775 With labour then bypeeping in an eye
18776 Base and illustrious as the smoky light
18777 That's fed with stinking tallow it were fit
18778 That all the plagues of hell should at one time
18779 Encounter such revolt
18780 IMOGEN My lord I fear
18781 Has forgot Britain
18782 IACHIMO And himself Not I
18783 Inclin'd to this intelligence pronounce
18784 The beggary of his change but 'tis your graces
18785 That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
18786 Charms this report out
18787 IMOGEN Let me hear no more
18788 IACHIMO O dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
18789 With pity that doth make me sick A lady
18790 So fair and fasten'd to an empery
18791 Would make the great'st king double to be partner'd
18792 With tomboys hir'd with that self exhibition
18793 Which your own coffers yield with diseas'd ventures
18794 That play with all infirmities for gold
18795 Which rottenness can lend nature such boil'd stuff
18796 As well might poison poison Be reveng'd
18797 Or she that bore you was no queen and you
18798 Recoil from your great stock
18799 IMOGEN Reveng'd
18800 How should I be reveng'd If this be true
18801 As I have such a heart that both mine ears
18802 Must not in haste abuse if it be true
18803 How should I be reveng'd
18804 IACHIMO Should he make me
18805 Live like Diana's priest betwixt cold sheets
18806 Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
18807 In your despite upon your purse Revenge it
18808 I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
18809 More noble than that runagate to your bed
18810 And will continue fast to your affection
18811 Still close as sure
18812 IMOGEN What ho Pisanio
18813 IACHIMO Let me my service tender on your lips
18814 IMOGEN Away I do condemn mine ears that have
18815 So long attended thee If thou wert honourable
18816 Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
18817 For such an end thou seek'st as base as strange
18818 Thou wrong'st a gentleman who is as far
18819 From thy report as thou from honour and
18820 Solicits here a lady that disdains
18821 Thee and the devil alike What ho Pisanio
18822 The King my father shall be made acquainted
18823 Of thy assault If he shall think it fit
18824 A saucy stranger in his court to mart
18825 As in a Romish stew and to expound
18826 His beastly mind to us he hath a court
18827 He little cares for and a daughter who
18828 He not respects at all What ho Pisanio
18829 IACHIMO O happy Leonatus I may say
18830 The credit that thy lady hath of thee
18831 Deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
18832 Her assur'd credit Blessed live you long
18833 A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
18834 Country call'd his and you his mistress only
18835 For the most worthiest fit Give me your pardon
18836 I have spoke this to know if your affiance
18837 Were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
18838 That which he is new o'er and he is one
18839 The truest manner'd such a holy witch
18840 That he enchants societies into him
18841 Half all men's hearts are his

18843 IACHIMO He sits 'mongst men like a descended god
18844 He hath a kind of honour sets him of
18845 More than a mortal seeming Be not angry
18846 Most mighty Princess that I have adventur'd
18847 To try your taking of a false report which hath
18848 Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
18849 In the election of a sir so rare
18850 Which you know cannot err The love I bear him
18851 Made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
18852 Unlike all others chaffless Pray your pardon
18853 IMOGEN All's well sir take my pow'r i th court for yours

19148 That I which know my heart do here pronounce
19149 By th very truth of it I care not for you
19150 And am so near the lack of charity
19151 To accuse myself I hate you which I had rather
19152 You felt than make't my boast
19153 CLOTEN You sin against
19154 Obedience which you owe your father For
19155 The contract you pretend with that base wretch
19156 One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes
19157 With scraps o th court it is no contract none
19158 And though it be allowed in meaner parties
19159 Yet who than he more mean to knit their souls
19160 On whom there is no more dependency
19161 But brats and beggary in selffigur'd knot
19162 Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
19163 The consequence o th crown and must not foil
19164 The precious note of it with a base slave
19165 A hilding for a livery a squire's cloth
19166 A pantler not so eminent
19167 IMOGEN Profane fellow
19168 Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
19169 But what thou art besides thou wert too base
19170 To be his groom Thou wert dignified enough
19171 Even to the point of envy if 'twere made
19172 Comparative for your virtues to be styl'd
19173 The underhangman of his kingdom and hated
19174 For being preferr'd so well

19177 To be but nam'd of thee His mean'st garment
19178 That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer

19186 Frighted and ang'red worse Go bid my woman
19187 Search for a jewel that too casually
19188 Hath left mine arm It was thy master's shrew me
19189 If I would lose it for a revenue
19190 Of any king's in Europe I do think
19191 I saw't this morning confident I am
19192 Last night 'twas on mine arm I kiss'd it

19194 That I kiss aught but he

19204 But the worst of me So I leave you sir

19215 POSTHUMUS Not any but abide the change of time
19216 Quake in the present winter's state and wish
19217 That warmer days would come In these fear'd hopes
19218 I barely gratify your love they failing
19219 I must die much your debtor
19220 PHILARIO Your very goodness and your company
19221 O'erpays all I can do By this your king
19222 Hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius
19223 Will do's commission throughly and I think
19224 He'll grant the tribute send th arrearages
19225 Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance
19226 Is yet fresh in their grief
19227 POSTHUMUS I do believe
19228 Statist though I am none nor like to be
19229 That this will prove a war and you shall hear
19230 The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
19231 In our notfearing Britain than have tidings
19232 Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen
19233 Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
19234 Smil'd at their lack of skill but found their courage
19235 Worthy his frowning at Their discipline
19236 Now mingled with their courages will make known
19237 To their approvers they are people such
19238 That mend upon the world
19239 Enter IACHIMO
19240 PHILARIO See Iachimo
19241 POSTHUMUS The swiftest harts have posted you by land
19242 And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails
19243 To make your vessel nimble
19244 PHILARIO Welcome sir
19245 POSTHUMUS I hope the briefness of your answer made
19246 The speediness of your return
19247 IACHIMO Your lady
19248 Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon
19249 POSTHUMUS And therewithal the best or let her beauty
19250 Look through a casement to allure false hearts
19251 And be false with them
19252 IACHIMO Here are letters for you
19253 POSTHUMUS Their tenour good I trust
19254 IACHIMO 'Tis very like
19255 PHILARIO Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
19256 When you were there
19257 IACHIMO He was expected then
19258 But not approach'd
19259 POSTHUMUS All is well yet
19260 Sparkles this stone as it was wont or is't not
19261 Too dull for your good wearing
19262 IACHIMO If I have lost it
19263 I should have lost the worth of it in gold
19264 I'll make a journey twice as far t enjoy
19265 A second night of such sweet shortness which
19266 Was mine in Britain for the ring is won
19267 POSTHUMUS The stone's too hard to come by
19268 IACHIMO Not a whit
19269 Your lady being so easy
19270 POSTHUMUS Make not sir
19271 Your loss your sport I hope you know that we
19272 Must not continue friends
19273 IACHIMO Good sir we must
19274 If you keep covenant Had I not brought
19275 The knowledge of your mistress home I grant
19276 We were to question farther but I now
19277 Profess myself the winner of her honour
19278 Together with your ring and not the wronger
19279 Of her or you having proceeded but
19280 By both your wills
19281 POSTHUMUS If you can make't apparent
19282 That you have tasted her in bed my hand
19283 And ring is yours If not the foul opinion
19284 You had of her pure honour gains or loses
19285 Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
19286 To who shall find them
19287 IACHIMO Sir my circumstances
19288 Being so near the truth as I will make them
19289 Must first induce you to believe whose strength
19290 I will confirm with oath which I doubt not
19291 You'll give me leave to spare when you shall find
19292 You need it not
19293 POSTHUMUS Proceed
19294 IACHIMO First her bedchamber
19295 Where I confess I slept not but profess
19296 Had that was well worth watchingit was hang'd
19297 With tapestry of silk and silver the story
19298 Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
19299 And Cydnus swell'd above the banks or for
19300 The press of boats or pride A piece of work
19301 So bravely done so rich that it did strive
19302 In workmanship and value which I wonder'd
19303 Could be so rarely and exactly wrought
19304 Since the true life on't was
19305 POSTHUMUS This is true
19306 And this you might have heard of here by me
19307 Or by some other
19308 IACHIMO More particulars
19309 Must justify my knowledge
19310 POSTHUMUS So they must
19311 Or do your honour injury
19312 IACHIMO The chimney
19313 Is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
19314 Chaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures
19315 So likely to report themselves The cutter
19316 Was as another nature dumb outwent her
19317 Motion and breath left out
19318 POSTHUMUS This is a thing
19319 Which you might from relation likewise reap
19320 Being as it is much spoke of
19321 IACHIMO The roof o th chamber
19322 With golden cherubins is fretted her andirons
19323 I had forgot them were two winking Cupids
19324 Of silver each on one foot standing nicely
19325 Depending on their brands
19326 POSTHUMUS This is her honour
19327 Let it be granted you have seen all this and praise
19328 Be given to your remembrance the description
19329 Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
19330 The wager you have laid
19331 IACHIMO Then if you can [Shows the bracelet]
19332 Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel See
19333 And now 'tis up again It must be married
19334 To that your diamond I'll keep them
19335 POSTHUMUS Jove
19336 Once more let me behold it Is it that
19337 Which I left with her
19338 IACHIMO Sir I thank her that
19339 She stripp'd it from her arm I see her yet
19340 Her pretty action did outsell her gift
19341 And yet enrich'd it too She gave it me and said
19342 She priz'd it once
19343 POSTHUMUS May be she pluck'd it of
19344 To send it me
19345 IACHIMO She writes so to you doth she
19346 POSTHUMUS O no no no 'tis true Here take this too
19347 [Gives the ring]
19348 It is a basilisk unto mine eye
19349 Kills me to look on't Let there be no honour
19350 Where there is beauty truth where semblance love
19351 Where there's another man The vows of women
19352 Of no more bondage be to where they are made
19353 Than they are to their virtues which is nothing
19354 O above measure false
19355 PHILARIO Have patience sir
19356 And take your ring again 'tis not yet won
19357 It may be probable she lost it or
19358 Who knows if one her women being corrupted
19359 Hath stol'n it from her
19360 POSTHUMUS Very true
19361 And so I hope he came by't Back my ring
19362 Render to me some corporal sign about her
19363 More evident than this for this was stol'n
19364 IACHIMO By Jupiter I had it from her arm
19365 POSTHUMUS Hark you he swears by Jupiter he swears
19366 'Tis true nay keep the ring 'tis true I am sure
19367 She would not lose it Her attendants are
19368 All sworn and honourable they induc'd to steal it
19369 And by a stranger No he hath enjoy'd her
19370 The cognizance of her incontinency
19371 Is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
19372 There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
19373 Divide themselves between you
19374 PHILARIO Sir be patient
19375 This is not strong enough to be believ'd
19376 Of one persuaded well of
19377 POSTHUMUS Never talk on't
19378 She hath been colted by him
19379 IACHIMO If you seek
19380 For further satisfying under her breast
19381 Worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud
19382 Of that most delicate lodging By my life
19383 I kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger
19384 To feed again though full You do remember
19385 This stain upon her
19386 POSTHUMUS Ay and it doth confirm
19387 Another stain as big as hell can hold
19388 Were there no more but it
19389 IACHIMO Will you hear more
19390 POSTHUMUS Spare your arithmetic never count the turns
19391 Once and a million
19392 IACHIMO I'll be sworn
19393 POSTHUMUS No swearing
19394 If you will swear you have not done't you lie
19395 And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
19396 Thou'st made me cuckold
19397 IACHIMO I'll deny nothing
19398 POSTHUMUS O that I had her here to tear her limbmeal
19399 I will go there and do't i th court before
19400 Her father I'll do something Exit
19401 PHILARIO Quite besides
19402 The government of patience You have won
19403 Let's follow him and pervert the present wrath
19404 He hath against himself
19405 IACHIMO With all my heart Exeunt
19406 SCENE V
19407 Rome Another room in PHILARIO'S house
19408 Enter POSTHUMUS
19409 POSTHUMUS Is there no way for men to be but women
19410 Must be halfworkers We are all bastards
19411 And that most venerable man which I
19412 Did call my father was I know not where
19413 When I was stamp'd Some coiner with his tools
19414 Made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem'd
19415 The Dian of that time So doth my wife
19416 The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance
19417 Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
19418 And pray'd me oft forbearance did it with
19419 A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
19420 Might well have warm'd old Saturn that I thought her
19421 As chaste as unsunn'd snow O all the devils
19422 This yellow Iachimo in an hour was't not
19423 Or less at first Perchance he spoke not but
19424 Like a fullacorn'd boar a German one
19425 Cried 'O and mounted found no opposition
19426 But what he look'd for should oppose and she
19427 Should from encounter guard Could I find out
19428 The woman's part in me For there's no motion
19429 That tends to vice in man but I affirm
19430 It is the woman's part Be it lying note it
19431 The woman's flattering hers deceiving hers
19432 Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
19433 Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
19434 Nice longing slanders mutability
19435 All faults that man may name nay that hell knows
19436 Why hers in part or all but rather all
19437 For even to vice
19438 They are not constant but are changing still
19439 One vice but of a minute old for one
19440 Not half so old as that I'll write against them
19441 Detest them curse them Yet 'tis greater skill
19442 In a true hate to pray they have their will
19443 The very devils cannot plague them better Exit

19453 Britain A hall in CYMBELINE'S palace
19454 Enter in state CYMBELINE QUEEN CLOTEN and LORDS at one door
19455 and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and attendants
19456 CYMBELINE Now say what would Augustus Caesar with us
19457 LUCIUS When Julius Caesar whose remembrance yet
19458 Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
19459 Be theme and hearing ever was in this Britain
19460 And conquer'd it Cassibelan thine uncle
19461 Famous in Caesar's praises no whit less
19462 Than in his feats deserving it for him
19463 And his succession granted Rome a tribute
19464 Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
19465 Is left untender'd
19466 QUEEN And to kill the marvel
19467 Shall be so ever
19468 CLOTEN There be many Caesars
19469 Ere such another Julius Britain is
19470 A world by itself and we will nothing pay
19471 For wearing our own noses
19472 QUEEN That opportunity
19473 Which then they had to take from 's to resume
19474 We have again Remember sir my liege
19475 The kings your ancestors together with
19476 The natural bravery of your isle which stands
19477 As Neptune's park ribb'd and pal'd in
19478 With rocks unscalable and roaring waters
19479 With sands that will not bear your enemies boats
19480 But suck them up to th topmast A kind of conquest
19481 Caesar made here but made not here his brag
19482 Of 'came and saw and overcame With shame
19483 The first that ever touch'd him he was carried
19484 From off our coast twice beaten and his shipping
19485 Poor ignorant baubles on our terrible seas
19486 Like eggshells mov'd upon their surges crack'd
19487 As easily 'gainst our rocks for joy whereof
19488 The fam'd Cassibelan who was once at point
19489 O giglot fortune to master Caesar's sword
19490 Made Lud's Town with rejoicing fires bright
19491 And Britons strut with courage
19492 CLOTEN Come there's no more tribute to be paid Our kingdom is
19493 stronger than it was at that time and as I said there is no
19494 moe such Caesars Other of them may have crook'd noses but to
19495 owe such straight arms none
19496 CYMBELINE Son let your mother end
19497 CLOTEN We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan
19498 I do not say I am one but I have a hand Why tribute Why should
19499 we pay tribute If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket
19500 or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light
19501 else sir no more tribute pray you now
19502 CYMBELINE You must know
19503 Till the injurious Romans did extort
19504 This tribute from us we were free Caesar's ambition
19505 Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
19506 The sides o th world against all colour here
19507 Did put the yoke upon's which to shake of
19508 Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
19509 Ourselves to be
19510 CLOTEN We do
19511 CYMBELINE Say then to Caesar
19512 Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
19513 Ordain'd our laws whose use the sword of Caesar
19514 Hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
19515 Shall by the power we hold be our good deed
19516 Though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws
19517 Who was the first of Britain which did put
19518 His brows within a golden crown and call'd
19519 Himself a king
19520 LUCIUS I am sorry Cymbeline
19521 That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar
19522 Caesar that hath moe kings his servants than
19523 Thyself domestic officers thine enemy
19524 Receive it from me then war and confusion
19525 In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee look
19526 For fury not to be resisted Thus defied
19527 I thank thee for myself
19528 CYMBELINE Thou art welcome Caius
19529 Thy Caesar knighted me my youth I spent

19554 On thy too ready hearing Disloyal No
19555 She's punish'd for her truth and undergoes
19556 More goddesslike than wifelike such assaults
19557 As would take in some virtue O my master
19558 Thy mind to her is now as low as were
19559 Thy fortunes How that I should murder her
19560 Upon the love and truth and vows which I
19561 Have made to thy command I her Her blood

19578 He'd lay the future open You good gods
19579 Let what is here contain'd relish of love
19580 Of my lord's health of his content yet not
19581 That we two are asunder let that grieve him

19599 How far 'tis thither If one of mean affairs
19600 May plod it in a week why may not I
19601 Glide thither in a day Then true Pisanio
19602 Who long'st like me to see thy lord who long'st
19603 O let me 'bate but not like me yet long'st
19604 But in a fainter kind O not like me
19605 For mine's beyond beyondsay and speak thick
19606 Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
19607 To th smothering of the sense how far it is
19608 To this same blessed Milford And by th way
19609 Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
19610 T inherit such a haven But first of all
19611 How we may steal from hence and for the gap
19612 That we shall make in time from our hencegoing
19613 And our return to excuse But first how get hence
19614 Why should excuse be born or ere begot
19615 We'll talk of that hereafter Prithee speak
19616 How many score of miles may we well ride
19617 'Twixt hour and hour
19618 PISANIO One score 'twixt sun and sun
19619 Madam 's enough for you and too much too
19620 IMOGEN Why one that rode to's execution man
19621 Could never go so slow I have heard of riding wagers
19622 Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
19623 That run i th clock's behalf But this is fool'ry
19624 Go bid my woman feign a sickness say
19625 She'll home to her father and provide me presently
19626 A riding suit no costlier than would fit
19627 A franklin's huswife
19628 PISANIO Madam you're best consider
19629 IMOGEN I see before me man Nor here nor here
19630 Nor what ensues but have a fog in them

19634 SCENE III
19635 Wales A mountainous country with a cave
19636 Enter from the cave BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
19637 BELARIUS A goodly day not to keep house with such
19638 Whose roof's as low as ours Stoop boys this gate
19639 Instructs you how t adore the heavens and bows you
19640 To a morning's holy office The gates of monarchs
19641 Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
19642 And keep their impious turbans on without
19643 Good morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heaven
19644 We house i th rock yet use thee not so hardly
19645 As prouder livers do
19646 GUIDERIUS Hail heaven
19647 ARVIRAGUS Hail heaven
19648 BELARIUS Now for our mountain sport Up to yond hill
19649 Your legs are young I'll tread these flats Consider
19650 When you above perceive me like a crow
19651 That it is place which lessens and sets off
19652 And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
19653 Of courts of princes of the tricks in war
19654 This service is not service so being done
19655 But being so allow'd To apprehend thus
19656 Draws us a profit from all things we see
19657 And often to our comfort shall we find
19658 The sharded beetle in a safer hold
19659 Than is the fullwing'd eagle O this life
19660 Is nobler than attending for a check
19661 Richer than doing nothing for a bribe
19662 Prouder than rustling in unpaidfor silk
19663 Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine
19664 Yet keeps his book uncross'd No life to ours
19665 GUIDERIUS Out of your proof you speak We poor unfledg'd
19666 Have never wing'd from view o th nest nor know not
19667 What air's from home Haply this life is best
19668 If quiet life be best sweeter to you
19669 That have a sharper known well corresponding
19670 With your stiff age But unto us it is
19671 A cell of ignorance travelling abed
19672 A prison for a debtor that not dares
19673 To stride a limit
19674 ARVIRAGUS What should we speak of
19675 When we are old as you When we shall hear
19676 The rain and wind beat dark December how
19677 In this our pinching cave shall we discourse
19678 The freezing hours away We have seen nothing
19679 We are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
19680 Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
19681 Our valour is to chase what flies our cage
19682 We make a choir as doth the prison'd bird
19683 And sing our bondage freely
19684 BELARIUS How you speak
19685 Did you but know the city's usuries
19686 And felt them knowingly the art o th court
19687 As hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
19688 Is certain falling or so slipp'ry that
19689 The fear's as bad as falling the toil o th war
19690 A pain that only seems to seek out danger
19691 I th'name of fame and honour which dies i th'search
19692 And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
19693 As record of fair act nay many times
19694 Doth ill deserve by doing well what's worse
19695 Must curtsy at the censure O boys this story
19696 The world may read in me my body's mark'd
19697 With Roman swords and my report was once
19698 first with the best of note Cymbeline lov'd me
19699 And when a soldier was the theme my name
19700 Was not far off Then was I as a tree
19701 Whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
19702 A storm or robbery call it what you will
19703 Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
19704 And left me bare to weather
19705 GUIDERIUS Uncertain favour
19706 BELARIUS My fault being nothing as I have told you oft
19707 But that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd
19708 Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline
19709 I was confederate with the Romans So
19710 Follow'd my banishment and this twenty years
19711 This rock and these demesnes have been my world
19712 Where I have liv'd at honest freedom paid
19713 More pious debts to heaven than in all
19714 The foreend of my time But up to th mountains
19715 This is not hunters language He that strikes
19716 The venison first shall be the lord o th feast
19717 To him the other two shall minister
19718 And we will fear no poison which attends
19719 In place of greater state I'll meet you in the valleys
19720 Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
19721 How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
19722 These boys know little they are sons to th King
19723 Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive
19724 They think they are mine and though train'd up thus meanly
19725 I th cave wherein they bow their thoughts do hit
19726 The roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
19727 In simple and low things to prince it much
19728 Beyond the trick of others This Polydore
19729 The heir of Cymbeline and Britain who
19730 The King his father call'd Guiderius Jove
19731 When on my threefoot stool I sit and tell
19732 The warlike feats I have done his spirits fly out
19733 Into my story say 'Thus mine enemy fell
19734 And thus I set my foot on's neck even then
19735 The princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
19736 Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
19737 That acts my words The younger brother Cadwal
19738 Once Arviragus in as like a figure
19739 Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
19740 His own conceiving Hark the game is rous'd
19741 O Cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
19742 Thou didst unjustly banish me Whereon
19743 At three and two years old I stole these babes
19744 Thinking to bar thee of succession as
19745 Thou refts me of my lands Euriphile
19746 Thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother
19747 And every day do honour to her grave
19748 Myself Belarius that am Morgan call'd
19749 They take for natural father The game is up Exit

19751 Wales near Milford Haven
19752 Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
19753 IMOGEN Thou told'st me when we came from horse the place
19754 Was near at hand Ne'er long'd my mother so
19755 To see me first as I have now Pisanio Man
19756 Where is Posthumus What is in thy mind
19757 That makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh
19758 From th inward of thee One but painted thus
19759 Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
19760 Beyond selfexplication Put thyself
19761 Into a haviour of less fear ere wildness
19762 Vanquish my staider senses What's the matter
19763 Why tender'st thou that paper to me with
19764 A look untender If't be summer news
19765 Smile to't before if winterly thou need'st
19766 But keep that count'nance still My husband's hand
19767 That drugdamn'd Italy hath outcraftied him
19768 And he's at some hard point Speak man thy tongue
19769 May take off some extremity which to read
19770 Would be even mortal to me
19771 PISANIO Please you read
19772 And you shall find me wretched man a thing
19773 The most disdain'd of fortune
19774 IMOGEN [Reads] 'Thy mistress Pisanio hath play'd the strumpet in
19775 my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me I speak not
19776 out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as
19777 certain as I expect my revenge That part thou Pisanio must act
19778 for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers Let
19779 thine own hands take away her life I shall give thee opportunity
19780 at Milford Haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if
19781 thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art
19782 the pander to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal'
19783 PISANIO What shall I need to draw my sword The paper
19784 Hath cut her throat already No 'tis slander
19785 Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
19786 Outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath
19787 Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
19788 All corners of the world Kings queens and states
19789 Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
19790 This viperous slander enters What cheer madam
19791 IMOGEN False to his bed What is it to be false
19792 To lie in watch there and to think on him
19793 To weep twixt clock and clock If sleep charge nature
19794 To break it with a fearful dream of him
19795 And cry myself awake That's false to's bed
19796 Is it
19797 PISANIO Alas good lady
19798 IMOGEN I false Thy conscience witness Iachimo
19799 Thou didst accuse him of incontinency
19800 Thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks
19801 Thy favour's good enough Some jay of Italy
19802 Whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him
19803 Poor I am stale a garment out of fashion
19804 And for I am richer than to hang by th walls
19805 I must be ripp'd To pieces with me O
19806 Men's vows are women's traitors All good seeming
19807 By thy revolt O husband shall be thought
19808 Put on for villainy not born where't grows
19809 But worn a bait for ladies
19810 PISANIO Good madam hear me
19811 IMOGEN True honest men being heard like false Aeneas
19812 Were in his time thought false and Sinon's weeping
19813 Did scandal many a holy tear took pity
19814 From most true wretchedness So thou Posthumus
19815 Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
19816 Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd
19817 From thy great fail Come fellow be thou honest
19818 Do thou thy master's bidding when thou seest him
19819 A little witness my obedience Look
19820 I draw the sword myself take it and hit
19821 The innocent mansion of my love my heart
19822 Fear not 'tis empty of all things but grief
19823 Thy master is not there who was indeed
19824 The riches of it Do his bidding strike
19825 Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
19826 But now thou seem'st a coward
19827 PISANIO Hence vile instrument
19828 Thou shalt not damn my hand
19829 IMOGEN Why I must die
19830 And if I do not by thy hand thou art
19831 No servant of thy master's Against selfslaughter
19832 There is a prohibition so divine
19833 That cravens my weak hand Come here's my heart
19834 Something's afore't Soft soft we'll no defence
19835 Obedient as the scabbard What is here
19836 The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
19837 All turn'd to heresy Away away
19838 Corrupters of my faith you shall no more
19839 Be stomachers to my heart Thus may poor fools
19840 Believe false teachers though those that are betray'd
19841 Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
19842 Stands in worse case of woe And thou Posthumus
19843 That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King
19844 My father and make me put into contempt the suits
19845 Of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
19846 It is no act of common passage but
19847 A strain of rareness and I grieve myself
19848 To think when thou shalt be disedg'd by her
19849 That now thou tirest on how thy memory
19850 Will then be pang'd by me Prithee dispatch
19851 The lamp entreats the butcher Where's thy knife
19852 Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
19853 When I desire it too
19854 PISANIO O gracious lady
19855 Since I receiv'd command to do this busines
19856 I have not slept one wink
19857 IMOGEN Do't and to bed then
19858 PISANIO I'll wake mine eyeballs first
19859 IMOGEN Wherefore then
19860 Didst undertake it Why hast thou abus'd
19861 So many miles with a pretence This place
19862 Mine action and thine own our horses labour
19863 The time inviting thee the perturb'd court
19864 For my being absent whereunto I never
19865 Purpose return Why hast thou gone so far
19866 To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand
19867 Th elected deer before thee
19868 PISANIO But to win time
19869 To lose so bad employment in the which
19870 I have consider'd of a course Good lady
19871 Hear me with patience
19872 IMOGEN Talk thy tongue weary speak
19873 I have heard I am a strumpet and mine ear
19874 Therein false struck can take no greater wound
19875 Nor tent to bottom that But speak
19876 PISANIO Then madam
19877 I thought you would not back again
19878 IMOGEN Most like
19879 Bringing me here to kill me
19880 PISANIO Not so neither
19881 But if I were as wise as honest then
19882 My purpose would prove well It cannot be
19883 But that my master is abus'd Some villain
19884 Ay and singular in his art hath done you both
19885 This cursed injury
19886 IMOGEN Some Roman courtezan
19887 PISANIO No on my life
19888 I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
19889 Some bloody sign of it for 'tis commanded
19890 I should do so You shall be miss'd at court
19891 And that will well confirm it
19892 IMOGEN Why good fellow
19893 What shall I do the while where bide how live
19894 Or in my life what comfort when I am
19895 Dead to my husband
19896 PISANIO If you'll back to th court
19897 IMOGEN No court no father nor no more ado
19898 With that harsh noble simple nothing
19899 That Cloten whose lovesuit hath been to me
19900 As fearful as a siege
19901 PISANIO If not at court
19902 Then not in Britain must you bide
19903 IMOGEN Where then
19904 Hath Britain all the sun that shines Day night
19905 Are they not but in Britain I th world's volume
19906 Our Britain seems as of it but not in't
19907 In a great pool a swan's nest Prithee think
19908 There's livers out of Britain

19912 Tomorrow Now if you could wear a mind
19913 Dark as your fortune is and but disguise

19918 That though his actions were not visible yet
19919 Report should render him hourly to your ear
19920 As truly as he moves
19921 IMOGEN O for such means
19922 Though peril to my modesty not death on't
19923 I would adventure
19924 PISANIO Well then here's the point
19925 You must forget to be a woman change
19926 Command into obedience fear and niceness
19927 The handmaids of all women or more truly
19928 Woman it pretty self into a waggish courage
19929 Ready in gibes quickanswer'd saucy and
19930 As quarrelous as the weasel Nay you must

20130 time the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart that she
20131 held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble
20132 and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities
20133 With that suit upon my back will I ravish her first kill him
20134 and in her eyes There shall she see my valour which will then
20135 be a torment to her contempt He on the ground my speech of

20482 BELARIUS We are all undone
20483 GUIDERIUS Why worthy father what have we to lose
20484 But that he swore to take our lives The law
20485 Protects not us then why should we be tender
20486 To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
20487 Play judge and executioner all himself
20488 For we do fear the law What company
20489 Discover you abroad
20490 BELARIUS No single soul
20491 Can we set eye on but in an safe reason
20492 He must have some attendants Though his humour
20493 Was nothing but mutation ay and that
20494 From one bad thing to worse not frenzy not
20495 Absolute madness could so far have rav'd
20496 To bring him here alone Although perhaps
20497 It may be heard at court that such as we
20498 Cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
20499 May make some stronger head the which he hearing
20500 As it is like him might break out and swear
20501 He'd fetch us in yet is't not probable
20502 To come alone either he so undertaking
20503 Or they so suffering Then on good ground we fear
20504 If we do fear this body hath a tail
20505 More perilous than the head
20506 ARVIRAGUS Let ordinance
20507 Come as the gods foresay it Howsoe'er
20508 My brother hath done well
20509 BELARIUS I had no mind
20510 To hunt this day the boy Fidele's sickness
20511 Did make my way long forth
20512 GUIDERIUS With his own sword
20513 Which he did wave against my throat I have ta'en
20514 His head from him I'll throw't into the creek
20515 Behind our rock and let it to the sea
20516 And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son Cloten
20517 That's all I reck Exit
20518 BELARIUS I fear'twill be reveng'd
20519 Would Polydore thou hadst not done't though valour
20520 Becomes thee well enough
20521 ARVIRAGUS Would I had done't
20522 So the revenge alone pursu'd me Polydore
20523 I love thee brotherly but envy much
20524 Thou hast robb'd me of this deed I would revenges
20525 That possible strength might meet would seek us through
20526 And put us to our answer
20527 BELARIUS Well 'tis done
20528 We'll hunt no more today nor seek for danger
20529 Where there's no profit I prithee to our rock
20530 You and Fidele play the cooks I'll stay
20531 Till hasty Polydore return and bring him
20532 To dinner presently
20533 ARVIRAGUS Poor sick Fidele
20534 I'll willingly to him to gain his colour
20535 I'd let a parish of such Cloten's blood
20536 And praise myself for charity Exit
20537 BELARIUS O thou goddess
20538 Thou divine Nature thou thyself thou blazon'st
20539 In these two princely boys They are as gentle
20540 As zephyrs blowing below the violet
20541 Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
20542 Their royal blood enchaf'd as the rud'st wind
20543 That by the top doth take the mountain pine
20544 And make him stoop to th vale 'Tis wonder
20545 That an invisible instinct should frame them
20546 To royalty unlearn'd honour untaught
20547 Civility not seen from other valour
20548 That wildly grows in them but yields a crop
20549 As if it had been sow'd Yet still it's strange
20550 What Cloten's being here to us portends
20551 Or what his death will bring us
20552 Reenter GUIDERIUS
20553 GUIDERIUS Where's my brother
20554 I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream
20555 In embassy to his mother his body's hostage
20556 For his return [Solemn music]
20557 BELARIUS My ingenious instrument
20558 Hark Polydore it sounds But what occasion
20559 Hath Cadwal now to give it motion Hark
20560 GUIDERIUS Is he at home
20561 BELARIUS He went hence even now
20562 GUIDERIUS What does he mean Since death of my dear'st mother
20563 It did not speak before All solemn things
20564 Should answer solemn accidents The matter
20565 Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
20566 Is jollity for apes and grief for boys
20567 Is Cadwal mad
20568 Reenter ARVIRAGUS with IMOGEN as dead bearing
20569 her in his arms
20570 BELARIUS Look here he comes
20571 And brings the dire occasion in his arms
20572 Of what we blame him for
20573 ARVIRAGUS The bird is dead
20574 That we have made so much on I had rather
20575 Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
20576 To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch
20577 Than have seen this
20578 GUIDERIUS O sweetest fairest lily
20579 My brother wears thee not the one half so well
20580 As when thou grew'st thyself
20581 BELARIUS O melancholy
20582 Who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
20583 The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
20584 Might'st easiliest harbour in Thou blessed thing
20585 Jove knows what man thou mightst have made but I
20586 Thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
20587 How found you him
20588 ARVIRAGUS Stark as you see
20589 Thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber
20590 Not as death's dart being laugh'd at his right cheek
20591 Reposing on a cushion
20592 GUIDERIUS Where
20593 ARVIRAGUS O th floor
20594 His arms thus leagu'd I thought he slept and put
20595 My clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
20596 Answer'd my steps too loud
20597 GUIDERIUS Why he but sleeps
20598 If he be gone he'll make his grave a bed
20599 With female fairies will his tomb be haunted
20600 And worms will not come to thee
20601 ARVIRAGUS With fairest flowers
20602 Whilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele
20603 I'll sweeten thy sad grave Thou shalt not lack
20604 The flower that's like thy face pale primrose nor
20605 The azur'd harebell like thy veins no nor
20606 The leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
20607 Outsweet'ned not thy breath The ruddock would
20608 With charitable bill O bill sore shaming
20609 Those richleft heirs that let their fathers lie
20610 Without a monument bring thee all this
20611 Yea and furr'd moss besides when flow'rs are none
20612 To winterground thy corse
20613 GUIDERIUS Prithee have done
20614 And do not play in wenchlike words with that
20615 Which is so serious Let us bury him
20616 And not protract with admiration what
20617 Is now due debt To th grave
20618 ARVIRAGUS Say where shall's lay him
20619 GUIDERIUS By good Euriphile our mother
20620 ARVIRAGUS Be't so
20621 And let us Polydore though now our voices
20622 Have got the mannish crack sing him to th ground
20623 As once to our mother use like note and words
20624 Save that Euriphile must be Fidele
20625 GUIDERIUS Cadwal
20626 I cannot sing I'll weep and word it with thee
20627 For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
20628 Than priests and fanes that lie
20629 ARVIRAGUS We'll speak it then
20630 BELARIUS Great griefs I see med'cine the less for Cloten
20631 Is quite forgot He was a queen's son boys
20632 And though he came our enemy remember
20633 He was paid for that Though mean and mighty rotting
20634 Together have one dust yet reverence
20635 That angel of the world doth make distinction
20636 Of place 'tween high and low Our foe was princely
20637 And though you took his life as being our foe
20638 Yet bury him as a prince
20639 GUIDERIUS Pray you fetch him hither
20640 Thersites body is as good as Ajax'
20641 When neither are alive
20642 ARVIRAGUS If you'll go fetch him
20643 We'll say our song the whilst Brother begin
20644 Exit BELARIUS
20645 GUIDERIUS Nay Cadwal we must lay his head to th East
20646 My father hath a reason for't
20647 ARVIRAGUS 'Tis true
20648 GUIDERIUS Come on then and remove him
20649 ARVIRAGUS So Begin
20650 SONG
20651 GUIDERIUS Fear no more the heat o th sun
20652 Nor the furious winter's rages
20653 Thou thy worldly task hast done
20654 Home art gone and ta'en thy wages
20655 Golden lads and girls all must
20656 As chimneysweepers come to dust
20657 ARVIRAGUS Fear no more the frown o th great
20658 Thou art past the tyrant's stroke
20659 Care no more to clothe and eat
20660 To thee the reed is as the oak
20661 The sceptre learning physic must
20662 All follow this and come to dust
20663 GUIDERIUS Fear no more the lightning flash
20664 ARVIRAGUS Nor th alldreaded thunderstone
20665 GUIDERIUS Fear not slander censure rash
20666 ARVIRAGUS Thou hast finish'd joy and moan
20667 BOTH All lovers young all lovers must
20668 Consign to thee and come to dust
20669 GUIDERIUS No exorciser harm thee
20670 ARVIRAGUS Nor no witchcraft charm thee
20671 GUIDERIUS Ghost unlaid forbear thee
20672 ARVIRAGUS Nothing ill come near thee
20673 BOTH Quiet consummation have
20674 And renowned be thy grave
20675 Reenter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN

20677 BELARIUS Here's a few flowers but 'bout midnight more
20678 The herbs that have on them cold dew o th night
20679 Are strewings fit'st for graves Upon their faces
20680 You were as flow'rs now wither'd Even so
20681 These herblets shall which we upon you strew
20682 Come on away Apart upon our knees
20683 The ground that gave them first has them again
20684 Their pleasures here are past so is their pain
20685 Exeunt all but IMOGEN
20686 IMOGEN [Awaking] Yes sir to Milford Haven Which is the way
20687 I thank you By yond bush Pray how far thither
20688 'Ods pittikins can it be six mile yet
20689 I have gone all night Faith I'll lie down and sleep
20690 But soft no bedfellow O gods and goddesses
20691 [Seeing the body]
20692 These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world
20693 This bloody man the care on't I hope I dream
20694 For so I thought I was a cavekeeper
20695 And cook to honest creatures But 'tis not so
20696 'Twas but a bolt of nothing shot at nothing
20697 Which the brain makes of fumes Our very eyes
20698 Are sometimes like our judgments blind Good faith
20699 I tremble still with fear but if there be
20700 Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
20701 As a wren's eye fear'd gods a part of it
20702 The dream's here still Even when I wake it is
20703 Without me as within me not imagin'd felt
20704 A headless man The garments of Posthumus
20705 I know the shape of's leg this is his hand
20706 His foot Mercurial his Martial thigh
20707 The brawns of Hercules but his Jovial face
20708 Murder in heaven How 'Tis gone Pisanio
20709 All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks
20710 And mine to boot be darted on thee Thou
20711 Conspir'd with that irregulous devil Cloten
20712 Hath here cut off my lord To write and read
20713 Be henceforth treacherous Damn'd Pisanio
20714 Hath with his forged letters damn'd Pisanio
20715 From this most bravest vessel of the world
20716 Struck the maintop O Posthumus alas
20717 Where is thy head Where's that Ay me where's that
20718 Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart
20719 And left this head on How should this be Pisanio
20720 'Tis he and Cloten malice and lucre in them
20721 Have laid this woe here O 'tis pregnant pregnant
20722 The drug he gave me which he said was precious
20723 And cordial to me have I not found it
20724 Murd'rous to th senses That confirms it home
20725 This is Pisanio's deed and Cloten O
20726 Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood
20727 That we the horrider may seem to those
20728 Which chance to find us O my lord my lord

20747 SOOTHSAYER Last night the very gods show'd me a vision
20748 I fast and pray'd for their intelligence thus
20749 I saw Jove's bird the Roman eagle wing'd
20750 From the spongy south to this part of the west

20756 Without his top The ruin speaks that sometime
20757 It was a worthy building How a page

20789 Thou shalt be so well master'd but be sure
20790 No less belov'd The Roman Emperor's letters
20791 Sent by a consul to me should not sooner
20792 Than thine own worth prefer thee Go with me
20793 IMOGEN I'll follow sir But first an't please the gods
20794 I'll hide my master from the flies as deep
20795 As these poor pickaxes can dig and when
20796 With wild woodleaves and weeds I ha strew'd his grave
20797 And on it said a century of prayers
20798 Such as I can twice o'er I'll weep and sigh
20799 And leaving so his service follow you
20800 So please you entertain me

20820 Upon a desperate bed and in a time
20821 When fearful wars point at me her son gone

20870 GUIDERIUS The noise is round about us
20871 BELARIUS Let us from it
20872 ARVIRAGUS What pleasure sir find we in life to lock it
20873 From action and adventure
20874 GUIDERIUS Nay what hope
20875 Have we in hiding us This way the Romans
20876 Must or for Britons slay us or receive us
20877 For barbarous and unnatural revolts
20878 During their use and slay us after
20879 BELARIUS Sons
20880 We'll higher to the mountains there secure us
20881 To the King's party there's no going Newness
20882 Of Cloten's death we being not known not muster'd
20883 Among the bandsmay drive us to a render
20884 Where we have liv'd and so extort from's that
20885 Which we have done whose answer would be death
20886 Drawn on with torture
20887 GUIDERIUS This is sir a doubt
20888 In such a time nothing becoming you
20889 Nor satisfying us
20890 ARVIRAGUS It is not likely
20891 That when they hear the Roman horses neigh
20892 Behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes
20893 And ears so cloy'd importantly as now
20894 That they will waste their time upon our note
20895 To know from whence we are
20896 BELARIUS O I am known
20897 Of many in the army Many years
20898 Though Cloten then but young you see not wore him
20899 From my remembrance And besides the King
20900 Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves
20901 Who find in my exile the want of breeding
20902 The certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
20903 To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd
20904 But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
20905 The shrinking slaves of winter
20906 GUIDERIUS Than be so
20907 Better to cease to be Pray sir to th army
20908 I and my brother are not known yourself
20909 So out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown
20910 Cannot be questioned
20911 ARVIRAGUS By this sun that shines
20912 I'll thither What thing is't that I never
20913 Did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood
20914 But that of coward hares hot goats and venison
20915 Never bestrid a horse save one that had
20916 A rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel
20917 Nor iron on his heel I am asham'd
20918 To look upon the holy sun to have
20919 The benefit of his blest beams remaining
20920 So long a poor unknown
20921 GUIDERIUS By heavens I'll go
20922 If you will bless me sir and give me leave
20923 I'll take the better care but if you will not
20924 The hazard therefore due fall on me by
20925 The hands of Romans

20928 So slight a valuation should reserve
20929 My crack'd one to more care Have with you boys

21019 Of his wings destitute the army broken
21020 And but the backs of Britons seen an flying
21021 Through a strait lane the enemy fullhearted
21022 Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work
21023 More plentiful than tools to do't struck down
21024 Some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling
21025 Merely through fear that the strait pass was damm'd
21026 With dead men hurt behind and cowards living
21027 To die with length'ned shame
21028 LORD Where was this lane
21029 POSTHUMUS Close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf
21030 Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
21031 An honest one I warrant who deserv'd
21032 So long a breeding as his white beard came to
21033 In doing this for's country Athwart the lane
21034 He with two striplings lads more like to run
21035 The country base than to commit such slaughter
21036 With faces fit for masks or rather fairer
21037 Than those for preservation cas'd or shame
21038 Made good the passage cried to those that fled

21048 With their own nobleness which could have turn'd
21049 A distaff to a lance gilded pale looks

21258 A father to me and thou hast created
21259 A mother and two brothers But O scorn
21260 Gone They went hence so soon as they were born
21261 And so I am awake Poor wretches that depend
21262 On greatness favour dream as I have done
21263 Wake and find nothing But alas I swerve
21264 Many dream not to find neither deserve
21265 And yet are steep'd in favours so am I
21266 That have this golden chance and know not why
21267 What fairies haunt this ground A book O rare one

21269 Nobler than that it covers Let thy effects
21270 So follow to be most unlike our courtiers

21276 stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his miseries
21277 Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty'
21278 'Tis still a dream or else such stuff as madmen
21279 Tongue and brain not either both or nothing
21280 Or senseless speaking or a speaking such

21286 POSTHUMUS Overroasted rather ready long ago
21287 GAOLER Hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are
21288 well cook'd
21289 POSTHUMUS So if I prove a good repast to the spectators the dish
21290 pays the shot
21291 GAOLER A heavy reckoning for you sir But the comfort is you
21292 shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills
21293 which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth
21294 You come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much
21295 drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are
21296 paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier
21297 for being too light the purse too light being drawn of
21298 heaviness O of this contradiction you shall now be quit O the
21299 charity of a penny cord It sums up thousands in a trice You
21300 have no true debitor and creditor but it of what's past is and
21301 to come the discharge Your neck sir is pen book and
21302 counters so the acquittance follows
21303 POSTHUMUS I am merrier to die than thou art to live
21304 GAOLER Indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache But a
21305 man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to
21306 bed I think he would change places with his officer for look
21307 you sir you know not which way you shall go
21308 POSTHUMUS Yes indeed do I fellow
21309 GAOLER Your death has eyes in's head then I have not seen him so
21310 pictur'd You must either be directed by some that take upon them
21311 to know or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
21312 know or jump the afterinquiry on your own peril And how you
21313 shall speed in your journey's end I think you'll never return to
21314 tell one
21315 POSTHUMUS I tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct
21316 them the way I am going but such as wink and will not use them
21317 GAOLER What an infinite mock is this that a man should have the
21318 best use of eyes to see the way of blindness I am sure hanging's
21319 the way of winking
21320 Enter a MESSENGER
21321 MESSENGER Knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the King
21322 POSTHUMUS Thou bring'st good news I am call'd to be made free

21324 POSTHUMUS Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the
21325 dead Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER
21326 GAOLER Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets
21327 I never saw one so prone Yet on my conscience there are verier
21328 knaves desire to live for all he be a Roman and there be some
21329 of them too that die against their wills so should I if I were

21500 IMOGEN My boon is that this gentleman may render
21501 Of whom he had this ring
21502 POSTHUMUS [Aside] What's that to him
21503 CYMBELINE That diamond upon your finger say
21504 How came it yours
21505 IACHIMO Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
21506 Which to be spoke would torture thee
21507 CYMBELINE How me
21508 IACHIMO I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
21509 Which torments me to conceal By villainy
21510 I got this ring 'twas Leonatus jewel
21511 Whom thou didst banish and which more may grieve thee
21512 As it doth me a nobler sir ne'er liv'd
21513 'Twixt sky and ground Wilt thou hear more my lord
21514 CYMBELINE All that belongs to this
21515 IACHIMO That paragon thy daughter
21516 For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
21517 Quail to remember Give me leave I faint
21518 CYMBELINE My daughter What of her Renew thy strength
21519 I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
21520 Than die ere I hear more Strive man and speak
21521 IACHIMO Upon a time unhappy was the clock
21522 That struck the hour was in Rome accurs'd
21523 The mansion where 'twas at a feast O would
21524 Our viands had been poison'd or at least
21525 Those which I heav'd to head the good Posthumus
21526 What should I say he was too good to be
21527 Where ill men were and was the best of all
21528 Amongst the rar'st of good ones sitting sadly
21529 Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
21530 For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
21531 Of him that best could speak for feature laming
21532 The shrine of Venus or straightpight Minerva
21533 Postures beyond brief nature for condition
21534 A shop of all the qualities that man
21535 Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
21536 Fairness which strikes the eye
21537 CYMBELINE I stand on fire
21538 Come to the matter
21539 IACHIMO All too soon I shall
21540 Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus
21541 Most like a noble lord in love and one
21542 That had a royal lover took his hint
21543 And not dispraising whom we prais'd therein
21544 He was as calm as virtue he began
21545 His mistress picture which by his tongue being made
21546 And then a mind put in't either our brags
21547 Were crack'd of kitchen trulls or his description
21548 Prov'd us unspeaking sots
21549 CYMBELINE Nay nay to th purpose
21550 IACHIMO Your daughter's chastity there it begins
21551 He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
21552 And she alone were cold whereat I wretch
21553 Made scruple of his praise and wager'd with him
21554 Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
21555 Upon his honour'd finger to attain
21556 In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
21557 By hers and mine adultery He true knight
21558 No lesser of her honour confident
21559 Than I did truly find her stakes this ring
21560 And would so had it been a carbuncle
21561 Of Phoebus wheel and might so safely had it
21562 Been all the worth of's car Away to Britain
21563 Post I in this design Well may you sir
21564 Remember me at court where I was taught
21565 Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
21566 'Twixt amorous and villainous Being thus quench'd
21567 Of hope not longing mine Italian brain
21568 Gan in your duller Britain operate
21569 Most vilely for my vantage excellent
21570 And to be brief my practice so prevail'd
21571 That I return'd with simular proof enough
21572 To make the noble Leonatus mad
21573 By wounding his belief in her renown
21574 With tokens thus and thus averring notes
21575 Of chamberhanging pictures this her bracelet
21576 O cunning how I got it nay some marks
21577 Of secret on her person that he could not
21578 But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
21579 I having ta'en the forfeit Whereupon
21580 Methinks I see him now

21626 Have said she 'given his mistress that confection
21627 Which I gave him for cordial she is serv'd
21628 As I would serve a rat'
21629 CYMBELINE What's this Cornelius
21630 CORNELIUS The Queen sir very oft importun'd me
21631 To temper poisons for her still pretending
21632 The satisfaction of her knowledge only
21633 In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
21634 Of no esteem I dreading that her purpose
21635 Was of more danger did compound for her
21636 A certain stuff which being ta'en would cease
21637 The present pow'r of life but in short time
21638 All offices of nature should again
21639 Do their due functions Have you ta'en of it
21640 IMOGEN Most like I did for I was dead

21661 That we meet here so strangely but her son
21662 Is gone we know not how nor where
21663 PISANIO My lord
21664 Now fear is from me I'll speak troth Lord Cloten
21665 Upon my lady's missing came to me
21666 With his sword drawn foam'd at the mouth and swore
21667 If I discover'd not which way she was gone
21668 It was my instant death By accident
21669 I had a feigned letter of my master's
21670 Then in my pocket which directed him
21671 To seek her on the mountains near to Milford
21672 Where in a frenzy in my master's garments
21673 Which he enforc'd from me away he posts
21674 With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
21675 My lady's honour What became of him
21676 I further know not
21677 GUIDERIUS Let me end the story
21678 I slew him there
21679 CYMBELINE Marry the gods forfend
21680 I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
21681 Pluck a hard sentence Prithee valiant youth
21682 Deny't again
21683 GUIDERIUS I have spoke it and I did it
21684 CYMBELINE He was a prince
21685 GUIDERIUS A most incivil one The wrongs he did me
21686 Were nothing princelike for he did provoke me
21687 With language that would make me spurn the sea
21688 If it could so roar to me I cut off's head
21689 And am right glad he is not standing here
21690 To tell this tale of mine
21691 CYMBELINE I am sorry for thee
21692 By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd and must
21693 Endure our law Thou'rt dead

21697 And take him from our presence
21698 BELARIUS Stay sir King
21699 This man is better than the man he slew
21700 As well descended as thyself and hath
21701 More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
21702 Had ever scar for [To the guard] Let his arms alone
21703 They were not born for bondage
21704 CYMBELINE Why old soldier
21705 Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
21706 By tasting of our wrath How of descent
21707 As good as we
21708 ARVIRAGUS In that he spake too far
21709 CYMBELINE And thou shalt die for't
21710 BELARIUS We will die all three
21711 But I will prove that two on's are as good
21712 As I have given out him My sons I must
21713 For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
21714 Though haply well for you
21715 ARVIRAGUS Your danger's ours
21716 GUIDERIUS And our good his
21717 BELARIUS Have at it then by leave
21718 Thou hadst great King a subject who
21719 Was call'd Belarius

21722 BELARIUS He it is that hath
21723 Assum'd this age indeed a banish'd man

21737 They are the issue of your loins my liege
21738 And blood of your begetting
21739 CYMBELINE How my issue
21740 BELARIUS So sure as you your father's I old Morgan
21741 Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd
21742 Your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
21743 Itself and all my treason that I suffer'd
21744 Was all the harm I did These gentle princes
21745 For such and so they are these twenty years
21746 Have I train'd up those arts they have as
21747 Could put into them My breeding was sir as
21748 Your Highness knows Their nurse Euriphile
21749 Whom for the theft I wedded stole these children
21750 Upon my banishment I mov'd her to't
21751 Having receiv'd the punishment before
21752 For that which I did then Beaten for loyalty
21753 Excited me to treason Their dear loss
21754 The more of you 'twas felt the more it shap'd
21755 Unto my end of stealing them But gracious sir
21756 Here are your sons again and I must lose
21757 Two of the sweet'st companions in the world
21758 The benediction of these covering heavens
21759 Fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
21760 To inlay heaven with stars
21761 CYMBELINE Thou weep'st and speak'st
21762 The service that you three have done is more
21763 Unlike than this thou tell'st I lost my children
21764 If these be they I know not how to wish
21765 A pair of worthier sons
21766 BELARIUS Be pleas'd awhile

21768 Most worthy prince as yours is true Guiderius
21769 This gentleman my Cadwal Arviragus
21770 Your younger princely son he sir was lapp'd
21771 In a most curious mantle wrought by th hand
21772 Of his queen mother which for more probation
21773 I can with ease produce
21774 CYMBELINE Guiderius had
21775 Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
21776 It was a mark of wonder
21777 BELARIUS This is he
21778 Who hath upon him still that natural stamp
21779 It was wise nature's end in the donation
21780 To be his evidence now
21781 CYMBELINE O what am I
21782 A mother to the birth of three Ne'er mother
21783 Rejoic'd deliverance more Blest pray you be
21784 That after this strange starting from your orbs
21785 You may reign in them now O Imogen
21786 Thou hast lost by this a kingdom
21787 IMOGEN No my lord
21788 I have got two worlds by't O my gentle brothers
21789 Have we thus met O never say hereafter
21790 But I am truest speaker You call'd me brother
21791 When I was but your sister I you brothers
21792 When we were so indeed
21793 CYMBELINE Did you e'er meet
21794 ARVIRAGUS Ay my good lord
21795 GUIDERIUS And at first meeting lov'd
21796 Continu'd so until we thought he died
21797 CORNELIUS By the Queen's dram she swallow'd
21798 CYMBELINE O rare instinct
21799 When shall I hear all through This fierce abridgment
21800 Hath to it circumstantial branches which
21801 Distinction should be rich in Where how liv'd you
21802 And when came you to serve our Roman captive
21803 How parted with your brothers how first met them
21804 Why fled you from the court and whither These
21805 And your three motives to the battle with
21806 I know not how much more should be demanded
21807 And all the other bydependences
21808 From chance to chance but nor the time nor place
21809 Will serve our long interrogatories See
21810 Posthumus anchors upon Imogen
21811 And she like harmless lightning throws her eye
21812 On him her brothers me her master hitting
21813 Each object with a joy the counterchange
21814 Is severally in all Let's quit this ground
21815 And smoke the temple with our sacrifices
21816 [To BELARIUS] Thou art my brother so we'll hold thee ever
21817 IMOGEN You are my father too and did relieve me
21818 To see this gracious season
21819 CYMBELINE All o'erjoy'd
21820 Save these in bonds Let them be joyful too
21821 For they shall taste our comfort
21822 IMOGEN My good master
21823 I will yet do you service
21824 LUCIUS Happy be you
21825 CYMBELINE The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
21826 He would have well becom'd this place and grac'd
21827 The thankings of a king
21828 POSTHUMUS I am sir
21829 The soldier that did company these three
21830 In poor beseeming 'twas a fitment for
21831 The purpose I then follow'd That I was he
21832 Speak Iachimo I had you down and might
21833 Have made you finish
21834 IACHIMO [Kneeling] I am down again
21835 But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
21836 As then your force did Take that life beseech you
21837 Which I so often owe but your ring first
21838 And here the bracelet of the truest princess
21839 That ever swore her faith
21840 POSTHUMUS Kneel not to me
21841 The pow'r that I have on you is to spare you
21842 The malice towards you to forgive you Live
21843 And deal with others better
21844 CYMBELINE Nobly doom'd
21845 We'll learn our freeness of a soninlaw
21846 Pardon's the word to all
21847 ARVIRAGUS You holp us sir
21848 As you did mean indeed to be our brother
21849 Joy'd are we that you are
21850 POSTHUMUS Your servant Princes Good my lord of Rome
21851 Call forth your soothsayer As I slept methought
21852 Great Jupiter upon his eagle back'd
21853 Appear'd to me with other spritely shows
21854 Of mine own kindred When I wak'd I found
21855 This label on my bosom whose containing
21856 Is so from sense in hardness that I can
21857 Make no collection of it Let him show
21858 His skill in the construction
21859 LUCIUS Philarmonus
21860 SOOTHSAYER Here my good lord
21861 LUCIUS Read and declare the meaning
21862 SOOTHSAYER [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall to himself
21863 unknown without seeking find and be embrac'd by
21864 a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall
21865 be lopp'd branches which being dead many years shall
21866 after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow
21867 then shall Posthumus end his miseries Britain be fortunate
21868 and flourish in peace and plenty'
21869 Thou Leonatus art the lion's whelp
21870 The fit and apt construction of thy name
21871 Being Leonatus doth import so much
21872 [To CYMBELINE] The piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter
21873 Which we call 'mollis aer and 'mollis aer'
21874 We term it 'mulier which 'mulier I divine
21875 Is this most constant wife who even now
21876 Answering the letter of the oracle
21877 Unknown to you unsought were clipp'd about
21878 With this most tender air
21879 CYMBELINE This hath some seeming
21880 SOOTHSAYER The lofty cedar royal Cymbeline
21881 Personates thee and thy lopp'd branches point
21882 Thy two sons forth who by Belarius stol'n
21883 For many years thought dead are now reviv'd
21884 To the majestic cedar join'd whose issue
21885 Promises Britain peace and plenty
21886 CYMBELINE Well
21887 My peace we will begin And Caius Lucius
21888 Although the victor we submit to Caesar
21889 And to the Roman empire promising
21890 To pay our wonted tribute from the which
21891 We were dissuaded by our wicked queen
21892 Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
21893 Have laid most heavy hand
21894 SOOTHSAYER The fingers of the pow'rs above do tune
21895 The harmony of this peace The vision
21896 Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
21897 Of yet this scarcecold battle at this instant
21898 Is full accomplish'd for the Roman eagle
21899 From south to west on wing soaring aloft
21900 Lessen'd herself and in the beams o th sun
21901 So vanish'd which foreshow'd our princely eagle
21902 Th'imperial Caesar Caesar should again unite
21903 His favour with the radiant Cymbeline
21904 Which shines here in the west
21905 CYMBELINE Laud we the gods
21906 And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
21907 From our bless'd altars Publish we this peace
21908 To all our subjects Set we forward let
21909 A Roman and a British ensign wave
21910 Friendly together So through Lud's Town march
21911 And in the temple of great Jupiter
21912 Our peace we'll ratify seal it with feasts
21913 Set on there Never was a war did cease
21914 Ere bloody hands were wash'd with such a peace Exeunt

21962 SCENE Elsinore
21963 ACT I Scene I
21964 Elsinore A platform before the Castle
21965 Enter two Sentinels[first] Francisco [who paces up and down
21966 at his post then] Bernardo [who approaches him]
21967 Ber Who's there
21968 Fran Nay answer me Stand and unfold yourself
21969 Ber Long live the King
21970 Fran Bernardo
21971 Ber He
21972 Fran You come most carefully upon your hour
21973 Ber 'Tis now struck twelve Get thee to bed Francisco
21974 Fran For this relief much thanks 'Tis bitter cold
21975 And I am sick at heart
21976 Ber Have you had quiet guard
21977 Fran Not a mouse stirring
21978 Ber Well good night
21979 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus
21980 The rivals of my watch bid them make haste
21981 Enter Horatio and Marcellus
21982 Fran I think I hear them Stand ho Who is there
21983 Hor Friends to this ground
21984 Mar And liegemen to the Dane
21985 Fran Give you good night
21986 Mar O farewell honest soldier
21987 Who hath reliev'd you
21988 Fran Bernardo hath my place
21989 Give you good night Exit
21990 Mar Holla Bernardo
21991 Ber Say
21992 What is Horatio there
21993 Hor A piece of him
21994 Ber Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus
21995 Mar What has this thing appear'd again tonight
21996 Ber I have seen nothing
21997 Mar Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy
21998 And will not let belief take hold of him
21999 Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
22000 Therefore I have entreated him along
22001 With us to watch the minutes of this night
22002 That if again this apparition come
22003 He may approve our eyes and speak to it
22004 Hor Tush tush 'twill not appear
22005 Ber Sit down awhile
22006 And let us once again assail your ears
22007 That are so fortified against our story
22008 What we two nights have seen
22009 Hor Well sit we down
22010 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
22011 Ber Last night of all
22012 When yond same star that's westward from the pole
22013 Had made his course t illume that part of heaven
22014 Where now it burns Marcellus and myself
22015 The bell then beating one
22016 Enter Ghost
22017 Mar Peace break thee off Look where it comes again
22018 Ber In the same figure like the King that's dead
22019 Mar Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio
22020 Ber Looks it not like the King Mark it Horatio
22021 Hor Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder
22022 Ber It would be spoke to
22023 Mar Question it Horatio
22024 Hor What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
22025 Together with that fair and warlike form
22026 In which the majesty of buried Denmark
22027 Did sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak
22028 Mar It is offended
22029 Ber See it stalks away
22030 Hor Stay Speak speak I charge thee speak
22031 Exit Ghost
22032 Mar 'Tis gone and will not answer
22033 Ber How now Horatio You tremble and look pale
22034 Is not this something more than fantasy
22035 What think you on't
22036 Hor Before my God I might not this believe
22037 Without the sensible and true avouch
22038 Of mine own eyes
22039 Mar Is it not like the King
22040 Hor As thou art to thyself
22041 Such was the very armour he had on
22042 When he th ambitious Norway combated
22043 So frown'd he once when in an angry parle
22044 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
22045 'Tis strange
22046 Mar Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
22047 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
22048 Hor In what particular thought to work I know not
22049 But in the gross and scope of my opinion
22050 This bodes some strange eruption to our state
22051 Mar Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
22052 Why this same strict and most observant watch
22053 So nightly toils the subject of the land
22054 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
22055 And foreign mart for implements of war
22056 Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
22057 Does not divide the Sunday from the week
22058 What might be toward that this sweaty haste
22059 Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day
22060 Who is't that can inform me
22061 Hor That can I
22062 At least the whisper goes so Our last king
22063 Whose image even but now appear'd to us
22064 Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
22065 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride
22066 Dar'd to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet
22067 For so this side of our known world esteem'd him
22068 Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seal'd compact
22069 Well ratified by law and heraldry
22070 Did forfeit with his life all those his lands
22071 Which he stood seiz'd of to the conqueror
22072 Against the which a moiety competent
22073 Was gaged by our king which had return'd
22074 To the inheritance of Fortinbras
22075 Had he been vanquisher as by the same comart
22076 And carriage of the article design'd
22077 His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
22078 Of unimproved mettle hot and full
22079 Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
22080 Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes
22081 For food and diet to some enterprise
22082 That hath a stomach in't which is no other
22083 As it doth well appear unto our state
22084 But to recover of us by strong hand
22085 And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
22086 So by his father lost and this I take it
22087 Is the main motive of our preparations
22088 The source of this our watch and the chief head
22089 Of this posthaste and romage in the land
22090 Ber I think it be no other but e'en so
22091 Well may it sort that this portentous figure
22092 Comes armed through our watch so like the King
22093 That was and is the question of these wars
22094 Hor A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye
22095 In the most high and palmy state of Rome
22096 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
22097 The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
22098 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
22099 As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
22100 Disasters in the sun and the moist star
22101 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
22102 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
22103 And even the like precurse of fierce events
22104 As harbingers preceding still the fates
22105 And prologue to the omen coming on
22106 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
22107 Unto our climature and countrymen
22108 Enter Ghost again
22109 But soft behold Lo where it comes again
22110 I'll cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
22111 Spreads his arms
22112 If thou hast any sound or use of voice
22113 Speak to me
22114 If there be any good thing to be done
22115 That may to thee do ease and race to me
22116 Speak to me
22117 If thou art privy to thy country's fate
22118 Which happily foreknowing may avoid
22119 O speak
22120 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
22121 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
22122 For which they say you spirits oft walk in death
22123 The cock crows
22124 Speak of it Stay and speak Stop it Marcellus
22125 Mar Shall I strike at it with my partisan
22126 Hor Do if it will not stand
22127 Ber 'Tis here
22128 Hor 'Tis here
22129 Mar 'Tis gone
22130 Exit Ghost
22131 We do it wrong being so majestical
22132 To offer it the show of violence
22133 For it is as the air invulnerable
22134 And our vain blows malicious mockery
22135 Ber It was about to speak when the cock crew
22136 Hor And then it started like a guilty thing
22137 Upon a fearful summons I have heard
22138 The cock that is the trumpet to the morn
22139 Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
22140 Awake the god of day and at his warning
22141 Whether in sea or fire in earth or air
22142 Th extravagant and erring spirit hies
22143 To his confine and of the truth herein
22144 This present object made probation
22145 Mar It faded on the crowing of the cock
22146 Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
22147 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated
22148 The bird of dawning singeth all night long
22149 And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
22150 The nights are wholesome then no planets strike
22151 No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
22152 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time
22153 Hor So have I heard and do in part believe it
22154 But look the morn in russet mantle clad
22155 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill
22156 Break we our watch up and by my advice
22157 Let us impart what we have seen tonight
22158 Unto young Hamlet for upon my life
22159 This spirit dumb to us will speak to him
22160 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
22161 As needful in our loves fitting our duty
22162 Let's do't I pray and I this morning know
22163 Where we shall find him most conveniently Exeunt
22164 Scene II
22165 Elsinore A room of state in the Castle
22166 Flourish [Enter Claudius King of Denmark Gertrude the Queen Hamlet
22167 Polonius Laertes and his sister Ophelia [Voltemand Cornelius]
22168 Lords Attendant
22169 King Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
22170 The memory be green and that it us befitted
22171 To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
22172 To be contracted in one brow of woe
22173 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
22174 That we with wisest sorrow think on him
22175 Together with remembrance of ourselves
22176 Therefore our sometime sister now our queen
22177 Th imperial jointress to this warlike state
22178 Have we as 'twere with a defeated joy
22179 With an auspicious and a dropping eye
22180 With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
22181 In equal scale weighing delight and dole
22182 Taken to wife nor have we herein barr'd
22183 Your better wisdoms which have freely gone
22184 With this affair along For all our thanks
22185 Now follows that you know young Fortinbras
22186 Holding a weak supposal of our worth
22187 Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
22188 Our state to be disjoint and out of frame
22189 Colleagued with this dream of his advantage
22190 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
22191 Importing the surrender of those lands
22192 Lost by his father with all bands of law
22193 To our most valiant brother So much for him
22194 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
22195 Thus much the business is we have here writ
22196 To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras
22197 Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
22198 Of this his nephew's purpose to suppress
22199 His further gait herein in that the levies
22200 The lists and full proportions are all made
22201 Out of his subject and we here dispatch
22202 You good Cornelius and you Voltemand
22203 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
22204 Giving to you no further personal power
22205 To business with the King more than the scope
22206 Of these dilated articles allow [Gives a paper]
22207 Farewell and let your haste commend your duty
22208 Cor Volt In that and all things will we show our duty
22209 King We doubt it nothing Heartily farewell
22210 Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius
22211 And now Laertes what's the news with you
22212 You told us of some suit What is't Laertes
22213 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
22214 And lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes
22215 That shall not be my offer not thy asking
22216 The head is not more native to the heart
22217 The hand more instrumental to the mouth
22218 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
22219 What wouldst thou have Laertes
22220 Laer My dread lord
22221 Your leave and favour to return to France
22222 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
22223 To show my duty in your coronation
22224 Yet now I must confess that duty done
22225 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
22226 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
22227 King Have you your father's leave What says Polonius
22228 Pol He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
22229 By laboursome petition and at last
22230 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent
22231 I do beseech you give him leave to go
22232 King Take thy fair hour Laertes Time be thine
22233 And thy best graces spend it at thy will
22234 But now my cousin Hamlet and my son
22235 Ham [aside] A little more than kin and less than kind
22236 King How is it that the clouds still hang on you
22237 Ham Not so my lord I am too much i th sun
22238 Queen Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
22239 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
22240 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
22241 Seek for thy noble father in the dust
22242 Thou know'st 'tis common All that lives must die
22243 Passing through nature to eternity
22244 Ham Ay madam it is common
22245 Queen If it be
22246 Why seems it so particular with thee
22247 Ham Seems madam Nay it is I know not 'seems'
22248 'Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
22249 Nor customary suits of solemn black
22250 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath
22251 No nor the fruitful river in the eye
22252 Nor the dejected havior of the visage
22253 Together with all forms moods shapes of grief
22254 'That can denote me truly These indeed seem
22255 For they are actions that a man might play
22256 But I have that within which passeth show
22257 These but the trappings and the suits of woe
22258 King 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet
22259 To give these mourning duties to your father
22260 But you must know your father lost a father
22261 That father lost lost his and the survivor bound
22262 In filial obligation for some term
22263 To do obsequious sorrow But to persever
22264 In obstinate condolement is a course
22265 Of impious stubbornness 'Tis unmanly grief
22266 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
22267 A heart unfortified a mind impatient
22268 An understanding simple and unschool'd
22269 For what we know must be and is as common
22270 As any the most vulgar thing to sense
22271 Why should we in our peevish opposition
22272 Take it to heart Fie 'tis a fault to heaven
22273 A fault against the dead a fault to nature
22274 To reason most absurd whose common theme
22275 Is death of fathers and who still hath cried
22276 From the first corse till he that died today
22277 'This must be so We pray you throw to earth
22278 This unprevailing woe and think of us
22279 As of a father for let the world take note
22280 You are the most immediate to our throne
22281 And with no less nobility of love
22282 Than that which dearest father bears his son
22283 Do I impart toward you For your intent
22284 In going back to school in Wittenberg
22285 It is most retrograde to our desire
22286 And we beseech you bend you to remain
22287 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
22288 Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
22289 Queen Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
22290 I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg
22291 Ham I shall in all my best obey you madam
22292 King Why 'tis a loving and a fair reply
22293 Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
22294 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
22295 Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
22296 No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
22297 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
22298 And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again
22299 Respeaking earthly thunder Come away
22300 Flourish Exeunt all but Hamlet
22301 Ham O that this too too solid flesh would melt
22302 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew
22303 Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
22304 His canon 'gainst selfslaughter O God God
22305 How weary stale flat and unprofitable
22306 Seem to me all the uses of this world
22307 Fie on't ah fie 'Tis an unweeded garden
22308 That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
22309 Possess it merely That it should come to this
22310 But two months dead Nay not so much not two
22311 So excellent a king that was to this
22312 Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
22313 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
22314 Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth
22315 Must I remember Why she would hang on him
22316 As if increase of appetite had grown
22317 By what it fed on and yet within a month
22318 Let me not think on't Frailty thy name is woman
22319 A little month or ere those shoes were old
22320 With which she followed my poor father's body
22321 Like Niobe all tears why she even she
22322 O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
22323 Would have mourn'd longer married with my uncle
22324 My father's brother but no more like my father
22325 Than I to Hercules Within a month
22326 Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
22327 Had left the flushing in her galled eyes
22328 She married O most wicked speed to post
22329 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets
22330 It is not nor it cannot come to good
22331 But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
22332 Enter Horatio Marcellus and Bernardo
22333 Hor Hail to your lordship
22334 Ham I am glad to see you well
22335 Horatio or I do forget myself
22336 Hor The same my lord and your poor servant ever
22337 Ham Sir my good friend I'll change that name with you
22338 And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio
22339 Marcellus
22340 Mar My good lord
22341 Ham I am very glad to see you [To Bernardo] Good even sir
22342 But what in faith make you from Wittenberg
22343 Hor A truant disposition good my lord
22344 Ham I would not hear your enemy say so
22345 Nor shall you do my ear that violence
22346 To make it truster of your own report
22347 Against yourself I know you are no truant
22348 But what is your affair in Elsinore
22349 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
22350 Hor My lord I came to see your father's funeral
22351 Ham I prithee do not mock me fellow student
22352 I think it was to see my mother's wedding
22353 Hor Indeed my lord it followed hard upon
22354 Ham Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral bak'd meats
22355 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
22356 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
22357 Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
22358 My father methinks I see my father
22359 Hor O where my lord
22360 Ham In my mind's eye Horatio
22361 Hor I saw him once He was a goodly king
22362 Ham He was a man take him for all in all
22363 I shall not look upon his like again
22364 Hor My lord I think I saw him yesternight
22365 Ham Saw who
22366 Hor My lord the King your father
22367 Ham The King my father
22368 Hor Season your admiration for a while
22369 With an attent ear till I may deliver
22370 Upon the witness of these gentlemen
22371 This marvel to you
22372 Ham For God's love let me hear
22373 Hor Two nights together had these gentlemen
22374 Marcellus and Bernardo on their watch
22375 In the dead vast and middle of the night
22376 Been thus encount'red A figure like your father
22377 Armed at point exactly capape
22378 Appears before them and with solemn march
22379 Goes slow and stately by them Thrice he walk'd
22380 By their oppress'd and fearsurprised eyes
22381 Within his truncheon's length whilst they distill'd
22382 Almost to jelly with the act of fear
22383 Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
22384 In dreadful secrecy impart they did
22385 And I with them the third night kept the watch
22386 Where as they had deliver'd both in time
22387 Form of the thing each word made true and good
22388 The apparition comes I knew your father
22389 These hands are not more like
22390 Ham But where was this
22391 Mar My lord upon the platform where we watch'd
22392 Ham Did you not speak to it
22393 Hor My lord I did
22394 But answer made it none Yet once methought
22395 It lifted up it head and did address
22396 Itself to motion like as it would speak
22397 But even then the morning cock crew loud
22398 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
22399 And vanish'd from our sight
22400 Ham 'Tis very strange
22401 Hor As I do live my honour'd lord 'tis true
22402 And we did think it writ down in our duty
22403 To let you know of it
22404 Ham Indeed indeed sirs But this troubles me
22405 Hold you the watch tonight
22406 Both [Mar and Ber] We do my lord
22407 Ham Arm'd say you
22408 Both Arm'd my lord
22409 Ham From top to toe
22410 Both My lord from head to foot
22411 Ham Then saw you not his face
22412 Hor O yes my lord He wore his beaver up
22413 Ham What look'd he frowningly
22414 Hor A countenance more in sorrow than in anger
22415 Ham Pale or red
22416 Hor Nay very pale
22417 Ham And fix'd his eyes upon you
22418 Hor Most constantly
22419 Ham I would I had been there
22420 Hor It would have much amaz'd you
22421 Ham Very like very like Stay'd it long
22422 Hor While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
22423 Both Longer longer
22424 Hor Not when I saw't
22425 Ham His beard was grizzled no
22426 Hor It was as I have seen it in his life
22427 A sable silver'd
22428 Ham I will watch tonight
22429 Perchance 'twill walk again
22430 Hor I warr'nt it will
22431 Ham If it assume my noble father's person
22432 I'll speak to it though hell itself should gape
22433 And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
22434 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight
22435 Let it be tenable in your silence still
22436 And whatsoever else shall hap tonight
22437 Give it an understanding but no tongue
22438 I will requite your loves So fare you well
22439 Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve
22440 I'll visit you
22441 All Our duty to your honour
22442 Ham Your loves as mine to you Farewell
22443 Exeunt [all but Hamlet]
22444 My father's spirit in arms All is not well
22445 I doubt some foul play Would the night were come
22446 Till then sit still my soul Foul deeds will rise
22447 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes
22448 Exit
22449 Scene III
22450 Elsinore A room in the house of Polonius
22451 Enter Laertes and Ophelia
22452 Laer My necessaries are embark'd Farewell
22453 And sister as the winds give benefit
22454 And convoy is assistant do not sleep
22455 But let me hear from you
22456 Oph Do you doubt that
22457 Laer For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
22458 Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
22459 A violet in the youth of primy nature
22460 Forward not permanent sweet not lasting
22461 The perfume and suppliance of a minute
22462 No more
22463 Oph No more but so
22464 Laer Think it no more
22465 For nature crescent does not grow alone
22466 In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
22467 The inward service of the mind and soul
22468 Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
22469 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
22470 The virtue of his will but you must fear
22471 His greatness weigh'd his will is not his own
22472 For he himself is subject to his birth
22473 He may not as unvalued persons do
22474 Carve for himself for on his choice depends
22475 The safety and health of this whole state
22476 And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
22477 Unto the voice and yielding of that body
22478 Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
22479 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
22480 As he in his particular act and place
22481 May give his saying deed which is no further
22482 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
22483 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
22484 If with too credent ear you list his songs
22485 Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
22486 To his unmast'red importunity
22487 Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
22488 And keep you in the rear of your affection
22489 Out of the shot and danger of desire
22490 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
22491 If she unmask her beauty to the moon
22492 Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes
22493 The canker galls the infants of the spring
22494 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd
22495 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
22496 Contagious blastments are most imminent
22497 Be wary then best safety lies in fear
22498 Youth to itself rebels though none else near
22499 Oph I shall th effect of this good lesson keep
22500 As watchman to my heart But good my brother
22501 Do not as some ungracious pastors do
22502 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
22503 Whiles like a puff'd and reckless libertine
22504 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
22505 And recks not his own rede
22506 Laer O fear me not
22507 Enter Polonius
22508 I stay too long But here my father comes
22509 A double blessing is a double grace
22510 Occasion smiles upon a second leave
22511 Pol Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame
22512 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
22513 And you are stay'd for There my blessing with thee
22514 And these few precepts in thy memory
22515 Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue
22516 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act
22517 Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
22518 Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
22519 Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
22520 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
22521 Of each newhatch'd unfledg'd comrade Beware
22522 Of entrance to a quarrel but being in
22523 Bear't that th opposed may beware of thee
22524 Give every man thine ear but few thy voice
22525 Take each man's censure but reserve thy judgment
22526 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
22527 But not express'd in fancy rich not gaudy
22528 For the apparel oft proclaims the man
22529 And they in France of the best rank and station
22530 Are most select and generous chief in that
22531 Neither a borrower nor a lender be
22532 For loan oft loses both itself and friend
22533 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
22534 This above all to thine own self be true
22535 And it must follow as the night the day
22536 Thou canst not then be false to any man
22537 Farewell My blessing season this in thee
22538 Laer Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
22539 Pol The time invites you Go your servants tend
22540 Laer Farewell Ophelia and remember well
22541 What I have said to you
22542 Oph 'Tis in my memory lock'd
22543 And you yourself shall keep the key of it
22544 Laer Farewell Exit
22545 Pol What is't Ophelia he hath said to you
22546 Oph So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
22547 Pol Marry well bethought
22548 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
22549 Given private time to you and you yourself
22550 Have of your audience been most free and bounteous
22551 If it be so as so 'tis put on me
22552 And that in way of caution I must tell you
22553 You do not understand yourself so clearly
22554 As it behooves my daughter and your honour
22555 What is between you Give me up the truth
22556 Oph He hath my lord of late made many tenders
22557 Of his affection to me
22558 Pol Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl
22559 Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
22560 Do you believe his tenders as you call them
22561 Oph I do not know my lord what I should think
22562 Pol Marry I will teach you Think yourself a baby
22563 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
22564 Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
22565 Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
22566 Running it thus you'll tender me a fool
22567 Oph My lord he hath importun'd me with love
22568 In honourable fashion
22569 Pol Ay fashion you may call it Go to go to
22570 Oph And hath given countenance to his speech my lord
22571 With almost all the holy vows of heaven
22572 Pol Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know
22573 When the blood burns how prodigal the soul
22574 Lends the tongue vows These blazes daughter
22575 Giving more light than heat extinct in both
22576 Even in their promise as it is amaking
22577 You must not take for fire From this time
22578 Be something scanter of your maiden presence
22579 Set your entreatments at a higher rate
22580 Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet
22581 Believe so much in him that he is young
22582 And with a larger tether may he walk
22583 Than may be given you In few Ophelia
22584 Do not believe his vows for they are brokers
22585 Not of that dye which their investments show
22586 But mere implorators of unholy suits
22587 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
22588 The better to beguile This is for all
22589 I would not in plain terms from this time forth
22590 Have you so slander any moment leisure
22591 As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
22592 Look to't I charge you Come your ways
22593 Oph I shall obey my lord
22594 Exeunt
22595 Scene IV
22596 Elsinore The platform before the Castle
22597 Enter Hamlet Horatio and Marcellus
22598 Ham The air bites shrewdly it is very cold
22599 Hor It is a nipping and an eager air
22600 Ham What hour now
22601 Hor I think it lacks of twelve
22602 Mar No it is struck
22603 Hor Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season
22604 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
22605 A flourish of trumpets and two pieces go off
22606 What does this mean my lord
22607 Ham The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
22608 Keeps wassail and the swagg'ring upspring reels
22609 And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
22610 The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
22611 The triumph of his pledge
22612 Hor Is it a custom
22613 Ham Ay marry is't
22614 But to my mind though I am native here
22615 And to the manner born it is a custom
22616 More honour'd in the breach than the observance
22617 This heavyheaded revel east and west
22618 Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations
22619 They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
22620 Soil our addition and indeed it takes
22621 From our achievements though perform'd at height
22622 The pith and marrow of our attribute
22623 So oft it chances in particular men
22624 That for some vicious mole of nature in them
22625 As in their birth wherein they are not guilty
22626 Since nature cannot choose his origin
22627 By the o'ergrowth of some complexion
22628 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
22629 Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
22630 The form of plausive manners that these men
22631 Carrying I say the stamp of one defect
22632 Being nature's livery or fortune's star
22633 Their virtues else be they as pure as grace
22634 As infinite as man may undergo
22635 Shall in the general censure take corruption
22636 From that particular fault The dram of e'il
22637 Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal
22638 Enter Ghost
22639 Hor Look my lord it comes
22640 Ham Angels and ministers of grace defend us
22641 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd
22642 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
22643 Be thy intents wicked or charitable
22644 Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
22645 That I will speak to thee I'll call thee Hamlet
22646 King father royal Dane O answer me
22647 Let me not burst in ignorance but tell
22648 Why thy canoniz'd bones hearsed in death
22649 Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
22650 Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd
22651 Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
22652 To cast thee up again What may this mean
22653 That thou dead corse again in complete steel
22654 Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon
22655 Making night hideous and we fools of nature
22656 So horridly to shake our disposition
22657 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
22658 Say why is this wherefore What should we do
22659 Ghost beckons Hamlet
22660 Hor It beckons you to go away with it
22661 As if it some impartment did desire
22662 To you alone
22663 Mar Look with what courteous action
22664 It waves you to a more removed ground
22665 But do not go with it
22666 Hor No by no means
22667 Ham It will not speak Then will I follow it
22668 Hor Do not my lord
22669 Ham Why what should be the fear
22670 I do not set my life at a pin's fee
22671 And for my soul what can it do to that
22672 Being a thing immortal as itself
22673 It waves me forth again I'll follow it
22674 Hor What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
22675 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
22676 That beetles o'er his base into the sea
22677 And there assume some other horrible form
22678 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
22679 And draw you into madness Think of it
22680 The very place puts toys of desperation
22681 Without more motive into every brain
22682 That looks so many fadoms to the sea
22683 And hears it roar beneath
22684 Ham It waves me still
22685 Go on I'll follow thee
22686 Mar You shall not go my lord
22687 Ham Hold off your hands
22688 Hor Be rul'd You shall not go
22689 Ham My fate cries out
22690 And makes each petty artire in this body
22691 As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve
22692 [Ghost beckons]
22693 Still am I call'd Unhand me gentlemen
22694 By heaven I'll make a ghost of him that lets me
22695 I say away Go on I'll follow thee
22696 Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet
22697 Hor He waxes desperate with imagination
22698 Mar Let's follow 'Tis not fit thus to obey him
22699 Hor Have after To what issue wail this come
22700 Mar Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
22701 Hor Heaven will direct it
22702 Mar Nay let's follow him
22703 Exeunt
22704 Scene V
22705 Elsinore The Castle Another part of the fortifications
22706 Enter Ghost and Hamlet
22707 Ham Whither wilt thou lead me Speak I'll go no further
22708 Ghost Mark me
22709 Ham I will
22710 Ghost My hour is almost come
22711 When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
22712 Must render up myself
22713 Ham Alas poor ghost
22714 Ghost Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
22715 To what I shall unfold
22716 Ham Speak I am bound to hear
22717 Ghost So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
22718 Ham What
22719 Ghost I am thy father's spirit
22720 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night
22721 And for the day confin'd to fast in fires
22722 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
22723 Are burnt and purg'd away But that I am forbid
22724 To tell the secrets of my prison house
22725 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
22726 Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
22727 Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
22728 Thy knotted and combined locks to part
22729 And each particular hair to stand an end
22730 Like quills upon the fretful porpentine
22731 But this eternal blazon must not be
22732 To ears of flesh and blood List list O list
22733 If thou didst ever thy dear father love
22734 Ham O God
22735 Ghost Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther
22736 Ham Murther
22737 Ghost Murther most foul as in the best it is
22738 But this most foul strange and unnatural
22739 Ham Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift
22740 As meditation or the thoughts of love
22741 May sweep to my revenge
22742 Ghost I find thee apt
22743 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
22744 That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
22745 Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear
22746 'Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
22747 A serpent stung me So the whole ear of Denmark
22748 Is by a forged process of my death
22749 Rankly abus'd But know thou noble youth
22750 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
22751 Now wears his crown
22752 Ham O my prophetic soul
22753 My uncle
22754 Ghost Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
22755 With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
22756 O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
22757 So to seduce won to his shameful lust
22758 The will of my most seemingvirtuous queen
22759 O Hamlet what a fallingoff was there
22760 From me whose love was of that dignity
22761 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
22762 I made to her in marriage and to decline
22763 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
22764 To those of mine
22765 But virtue as it never will be mov'd
22766 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
22767 So lust though to a radiant angel link'd
22768 Will sate itself in a celestial bed
22769 And prey on garbage
22770 But soft methinks I scent the morning air
22771 Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard
22772 My custom always of the afternoon
22773 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
22774 With juice of cursed hebona in a vial
22775 And in the porches of my ears did pour
22776 The leperous distilment whose effect
22777 Holds such an enmity with blood of man
22778 That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
22779 The natural gates and alleys of the body
22780 And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
22781 And curd like eager droppings into milk
22782 The thin and wholesome blood So did it mine
22783 And a most instant tetter bark'd about
22784 Most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
22785 All my smooth body
22786 Thus was I sleeping by a brother's hand
22787 Of life of crown of queen at once dispatch'd
22788 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
22789 Unhous'led disappointed unanel'd
22790 No reckoning made but sent to my account
22791 With all my imperfections on my head
22792 Ham O horrible O horrible most horrible
22793 Ghost If thou hast nature in thee bear it not
22794 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
22795 A couch for luxury and damned incest
22796 But howsoever thou pursuest this act
22797 Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
22798 Against thy mother aught Leave her to heaven
22799 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
22800 To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once
22801 The glowworm shows the matin to be near
22802 And gins to pale his uneffectual fire
22803 Adieu adieu adieu Remember me Exit
22804 Ham O all you host of heaven O earth What else
22805 And shall I couple hell Hold hold my heart
22806 And you my sinews grow not instant old
22807 But bear me stiffly up Remember thee
22808 Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
22809 In this distracted globe Remember thee
22810 Yea from the table of my memory
22811 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records
22812 All saws of books all forms all pressures past
22813 That youth and observation copied there
22814 And thy commandment all alone shall live
22815 Within the book and volume of my brain
22816 Unmix'd with baser matter Yes by heaven
22817 O most pernicious woman
22818 O villain villain smiling damned villain
22819 My tables Meet it is I set it down
22820 That one may smile and smile and be a villain
22821 At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark [Writes]
22822 So uncle there you are Now to my word
22823 It is 'Adieu adieu Remember me'
22824 I have sworn't
22825 Hor within My lord my lord
22826 Enter Horatio and Marcellus
22827 Mar Lord Hamlet
22828 Hor Heaven secure him
22829 Ham So be it
22830 Mar Illo ho ho my lord
22831 Ham Hillo ho ho boy Come bird come
22832 Mar How is't my noble lord
22833 Hor What news my lord
22834 Mar O wonderful
22835 Hor Good my lord tell it
22836 Ham No you will reveal it
22837 Hor Not I my lord by heaven
22838 Mar Nor I my lord
22839 Ham How say you then Would heart of man once think it
22840 But you'll be secret
22841 Both Ay by heaven my lord
22842 Ham There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
22843 But he's an arrant knave
22844 Hor There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
22845 To tell us this
22846 Ham Why right You are in the right
22847 And so without more circumstance at all
22848 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
22849 You as your business and desires shall point you
22850 For every man hath business and desire
22851 Such as it is and for my own poor part
22852 Look you I'll go pray
22853 Hor These are but wild and whirling words my lord
22854 Ham I am sorry they offend you heartily
22855 Yes faith heartily
22856 Hor There's no offence my lord
22857 Ham Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio
22858 And much offence too Touching this vision here
22859 It is an honest ghost that let me tell you
22860 For your desire to know what is between us
22861 O'ermaster't as you may And now good friends
22862 As you are friends scholars and soldiers
22863 Give me one poor request
22864 Hor What is't my lord We will
22865 Ham Never make known what you have seen tonight
22866 Both My lord we will not
22867 Ham Nay but swear't
22868 Hor In faith
22869 My lord not I
22870 Mar Nor I my lord in faith
22871 Ham Upon my sword
22872 Mar We have sworn my lord already
22873 Ham Indeed upon my sword indeed
22874 Ghost cries under the stage
22875 Ghost Swear
22876 Ham Aha boy say'st thou so Art thou there truepenny
22877 Come on You hear this fellow in the cellarage
22878 Consent to swear

22880 Ham Never to speak of this that you have seen
22881 Swear by my sword
22882 Ghost [beneath] Swear
22883 Ham Hic et ubique Then we'll shift our ground
22884 Come hither gentlemen
22885 And lay your hands again upon my sword
22886 Never to speak of this that you have heard
22887 Swear by my sword
22888 Ghost [beneath] Swear by his sword

22890 A worthy pioner Once more remove good friends
22891 Hor O day and night but this is wondrous strange
22892 Ham And therefore as a stranger give it welcome
22893 There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio
22894 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
22895 But come
22896 Here as before never so help you mercy
22897 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
22898 As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
22899 To put an antic disposition on
22900 That you at such times seeing me never shall
22901 With arms encumb'red thus or this headshake
22902 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
22903 As 'Well well we know or 'We could an if we would'
22904 Or 'If we list to speak or 'There be an if they might'
22905 Or such ambiguous giving out to note
22906 That you know aught of me this is not to do
22907 So grace and mercy at your most need help you
22908 Swear
22909 Ghost [beneath] Swear
22910 [They swear]
22911 Ham Rest rest perturbed spirit So gentlemen
22912 With all my love I do commend me to you
22913 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
22914 May do t express his love and friending to you
22915 God willing shall not lack Let us go in together
22916 And still your fingers on your lips I pray
22917 The time is out of joint O cursed spite
22918 That ever I was born to set it right
22919 Nay come let's go together
22920 Exeunt

22931 Enter Polonius and Reynaldo
22932 Pol Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
22933 Rey I will my lord
22934 Pol You shall do marvell's wisely good Reynaldo
22935 Before You visit him to make inquire
22936 Of his behaviour
22937 Rey My lord I did intend it
22938 Pol Marry well said very well said Look you sir
22939 Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris
22940 And how and who what means and where they keep
22941 What company at what expense and finding
22942 By this encompassment and drift of question
22943 That they do know my son come you more nearer
22944 Than your particular demands will touch it
22945 Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him
22946 As thus 'I know his father and his friends
22947 And in part him Do you mark this Reynaldo
22948 Rey Ay very well my lord
22949 Pol 'And in part him but you may say 'not well
22950 But if't be he I mean he's very wild
22951 Addicted so and so and there put on him
22952 What forgeries you please marry none so rank
22953 As may dishonour him take heed of that
22954 But sir such wanton wild and usual slips
22955 As are companions noted and most known
22956 To youth and liberty
22957 Rey As gaming my lord
22958 Pol Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
22959 Drabbing You may go so far
22960 Rey My lord that would dishonour him
22961 Pol Faith no as you may season it in the charge
22962 You must not put another scandal on him
22963 That he is open to incontinency
22964 That's not my meaning But breathe his faults so quaintly
22965 That they may seem the taints of liberty
22966 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
22967 A savageness in unreclaimed blood
22968 Of general assault
22969 Rey But my good lord
22970 Pol Wherefore should you do this
22971 Rey Ay my lord
22972 I would know that
22973 Pol Marry sir here's my drift
22974 And I believe it is a fetch of warrant
22975 You laying these slight sullies on my son
22976 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i th working
22977 Mark you
22978 Your party in converse him you would sound
22979 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
22980 The youth you breathe of guilty be assur'd
22981 He closes with you in this consequence
22982 'Good sir or so or 'friend or 'gentleman'
22983 According to the phrase or the addition
22984 Of man and country
22985 Rey Very good my lord
22986 Pol And then sir does 'a this 'a does What was I about to say
22987 By the mass I was about to say something Where did I leave
22988 Rey At 'closes in the consequence at 'friend or so and
22989 gentleman'
22990 Pol At 'closes in the consequence Ay marry
22991 He closes thus 'I know the gentleman
22992 I saw him yesterday or t'other day
22993 Or then or then with such or such and as you say
22994 There was 'a gaming there o'ertook in's rouse
22995 There falling out at tennis or perchance
22996 'I saw him enter such a house of sale'
22997 Videlicet a brothel or so forth
22998 See you now
22999 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
23000 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
23001 With windlasses and with assays of bias
23002 By indirections find directions out
23003 So by my former lecture and advice
23004 Shall you my son You have me have you not
23005 Rey My lord I have
23006 Pol God b wi ye fare ye well
23007 Rey Good my lord [Going]
23008 Pol Observe his inclination in yourself
23009 Rey I shall my lord
23010 Pol And let him ply his music
23011 Rey Well my lord
23012 Pol Farewell
23013 Exit Reynaldo
23014 Enter Ophelia
23015 How now Ophelia What's the matter
23016 Oph O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
23017 Pol With what i th name of God I
23018 Oph My lord as I was sewing in my closet
23019 Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbrac'd
23020 No hat upon his head his stockings foul'd
23021 Ungart'red and downgyved to his ankle
23022 Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
23023 And with a look so piteous in purport
23024 As if he had been loosed out of hell
23025 To speak of horrors he comes before me
23026 Pol Mad for thy love
23027 Oph My lord I do not know
23028 But truly I do fear it
23029 Pol What said he
23030 Oph He took me by the wrist and held me hard
23031 Then goes he to the length of all his arm
23032 And with his other hand thus o'er his brow
23033 He falls to such perusal of my face
23034 As he would draw it Long stay'd he so
23035 At last a little shaking of mine arm
23036 And thrice his head thus waving up and down
23037 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
23038 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
23039 And end his being That done he lets me go
23040 And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
23041 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes
23042 For out o doors he went without their help
23043 And to the last bended their light on me
23044 Pol Come go with me I will go seek the King
23045 This is the very ecstasy of love
23046 Whose violent property fordoes itself
23047 And leads the will to desperate undertakings
23048 As oft as any passion under heaven
23049 That does afflict our natures I am sorry
23050 What have you given him any hard words of late
23051 Oph No my good lord but as you did command
23052 I did repel his letters and denied
23053 His access to me
23054 Pol That hath made him mad
23055 I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
23056 I had not quoted him I fear'd he did but trifle
23057 And meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy
23058 By heaven it is as proper to our age
23059 To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
23060 As it is common for the younger sort
23061 To lack discretion Come go we to the King
23062 This must be known which being kept close might move
23063 More grief to hide than hate to utter love
23064 Come
23065 Exeunt
23066 Scene II
23067 Elsinore A room in the Castle
23068 Flourish [Enter King and Queen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern cum aliis
23069 King Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
23070 Moreover that we much did long to see you
23071 The need we have to use you did provoke
23072 Our hasty sending Something have you heard
23073 Of Hamlet's transformation So I call it
23074 Sith nor th exterior nor the inward man
23075 Resembles that it was What it should be
23076 More than his father's death that thus hath put him
23077 So much from th understanding of himself
23078 I cannot dream of I entreat you both
23079 That being of so young clays brought up with him
23080 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour
23081 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
23082 Some little time so by your companies
23083 To draw him on to pleasures and to gather
23084 So much as from occasion you may glean
23085 Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
23086 That open'd lies within our remedy
23087 Queen Good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you
23088 And sure I am two men there are not living
23089 To whom he more adheres If it will please you
23090 To show us so much gentry and good will
23091 As to expend your time with us awhile
23092 For the supply and profit of our hope
23093 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
23094 As fits a king's remembrance
23095 Ros Both your Majesties
23096 Might by the sovereign power you have of us
23097 Put your dread pleasures more into command
23098 Than to entreaty
23099 Guil But we both obey
23100 And here give up ourselves in the full bent
23101 To lay our service freely at your feet
23102 To be commanded
23103 King Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
23104 Queen Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
23105 And I beseech you instantly to visit
23106 My too much changed son Go some of you
23107 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
23108 Guil Heavens make our presence and our practices
23109 Pleasant and helpful to him
23110 Queen Ay amen
23111 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern [with some
23112 Attendants]
23113 Enter Polonius
23114 Pol Th ambassadors from Norway my good lord
23115 Are joyfully return'd
23116 King Thou still hast been the father of good news
23117 Pol Have I my lord Assure you my good liege
23118 I hold my duty as I hold my soul
23119 Both to my God and to my gracious king
23120 And I do think or else this brain of mine
23121 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
23122 As it hath us'd to do that I have found
23123 The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy
23124 King O speak of that That do I long to hear
23125 Pol Give first admittance to th ambassadors
23126 My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
23127 King Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
23128 [Exit Polonius]
23129 He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found
23130 The head and source of all your son's distemper
23131 Queen I doubt it is no other but the main
23132 His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage
23133 King Well we shall sift him
23134 Enter Polonius Voltemand and Cornelius
23135 Welcome my good friends
23136 Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway
23137 Volt Most fair return of greetings and desires
23138 Upon our first he sent out to suppress
23139 His nephew's levies which to him appear'd
23140 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack
23141 But better look'd into he truly found
23142 It was against your Highness whereat griev'd
23143 That so his sickness age and impotence
23144 Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
23145 On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
23146 Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine
23147 Makes vow before his uncle never more
23148 To give th assay of arms against your Majesty
23149 Whereon old Norway overcome with joy
23150 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
23151 And his commission to employ those soldiers
23152 So levied as before against the Polack
23153 With an entreaty herein further shown
23154 [Gives a paper]
23155 That it might please you to give quiet pass
23156 Through your dominions for this enterprise
23157 On such regards of safety and allowance
23158 As therein are set down
23159 King It likes us well
23160 And at our more consider'd time we'll read
23161 Answer and think upon this business
23162 Meantime we thank you for your welltook labour
23163 Go to your rest at night we'll feast together
23164 Most welcome home Exeunt Ambassadors
23165 Pol This business is well ended
23166 My liege and madam to expostulate
23167 What majesty should be what duty is
23168 Why day is day night is night and time is time
23169 Were nothing but to waste night day and time
23170 Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
23171 And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
23172 I will be brief Your noble son is mad
23173 Mad call I it for to define true madness
23174 What is't but to be nothing else but mad
23175 But let that go
23176 Queen More matter with less art
23177 Pol Madam I swear I use no art at all
23178 That he is mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity
23179 And pity 'tis 'tis true A foolish figure
23180 But farewell it for I will use no art
23181 Mad let us grant him then And now remains
23182 That we find out the cause of this effect
23183 Or rather say the cause of this defect
23184 For this effect defective comes by cause
23185 Thus it remains and the remainder thus
23186 Perpend
23187 I have a daughter have while she is mine
23188 Who in her duty and obedience mark
23189 Hath given me this Now gather and surmise
23190 [Reads] the letter
23191 'To the celestial and my soul's idol the most beautified
23192 Ophelia'
23193 That's an ill phrase a vile phrase 'beautified is a vile
23194 phrase
23195 But you shall hear Thus
23196 [Reads]
23197 'In her excellent white bosom these &c'
23198 Queen Came this from Hamlet to her
23199 Pol Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful [Reads]
23200 'Doubt thou the stars are fire
23201 Doubt that the sun doth move
23202 Doubt truth to be a liar
23203 But never doubt I love
23204 'O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to
23205 reckon my groans but that I love thee best O most best believe
23206 it Adieu
23207 'Thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him
23208 HAMLET'
23209 This in obedience hath my daughter shown me
23210 And more above hath his solicitings
23211 As they fell out by time by means and place
23212 All given to mine ear
23213 King But how hath she
23214 Receiv'd his love
23215 Pol What do you think of me
23216 King As of a man faithful and honourable
23217 Pol I would fain prove so But what might you think
23218 When I had seen this hot love on the wing
23219 As I perceiv'd it I must tell you that
23220 Before my daughter told me what might you
23221 Or my dear Majesty your queen here think
23222 If I had play'd the desk or table book
23223 Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
23224 Or look'd upon this love with idle sight
23225 What might you think No I went round to work
23226 And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
23227 'Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
23228 This must not be And then I prescripts gave her
23229 That she should lock herself from his resort
23230 Admit no messengers receive no tokens
23231 Which done she took the fruits of my advice
23232 And he repulsed a short tale to make
23233 Fell into a sadness then into a fast
23234 Thence to a watch thence into a weakness
23235 Thence to a lightness and by this declension
23236 Into the madness wherein now he raves
23237 And all we mourn for
23238 King Do you think 'tis this
23239 Queen it may be very like
23240 Pol Hath there been such a time I would fain know that
23241 That I have Positively said ''Tis so'
23242 When it prov'd otherwise
23243 King Not that I know
23244 Pol [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this if this
23245 be otherwise
23246 If circumstances lead me I will find
23247 Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
23248 Within the centre
23249 King How may we try it further
23250 Pol You know sometimes he walks four hours together
23251 Here in the lobby
23252 Queen So he does indeed
23253 Pol At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him
23254 Be you and I behind an arras then
23255 Mark the encounter If he love her not
23256 And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
23257 Let me be no assistant for a state
23258 But keep a farm and carters
23259 King We will try it
23260 Enter Hamlet reading on a book
23261 Queen But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
23262 Pol Away I do beseech you both away
23263 I'll board him presently O give me leave
23264 Exeunt King and Queen [with Attendants]
23265 How does my good Lord Hamlet
23266 Ham Well Godamercy
23267 Pol Do you know me my lord
23268 Ham Excellent well You are a fishmonger
23269 Pol Not I my lord
23270 Ham Then I would you were so honest a man
23271 Pol Honest my lord
23272 Ham Ay sir To be honest as this world goes is to be one man
23273 pick'd out of ten thousand
23274 Pol That's very true my lord
23275 Ham For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a god
23276 kissing carrion Have you a daughter
23277 Pol I have my lord
23278 Ham Let her not walk i th sun Conception is a blessing but not
23279 as your daughter may conceive Friend look to't
23280 Pol [aside] How say you by that Still harping on my daughter Yet
23281 he knew me not at first He said I was a fishmonger He is far
23282 gone far gone And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
23283 for love very near this I'll speak to him again What do you
23284 read my lord
23285 Ham Words words words
23286 Pol What is the matter my lord
23287 Ham Between who
23288 Pol I mean the matter that you read my lord
23289 Ham Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men
23290 have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes
23291 purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a
23292 plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams All which
23293 sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it
23294 not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir
23295 should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backward
23296 Pol [aside] Though this be madness yet there is a method in't
23297 Will You walk out of the air my lord
23298 Ham Into my grave
23299 Pol Indeed that is out o th air [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
23300 his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which
23301 reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I
23302 will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
23303 him and my daughter My honourable lord I will most humbly take
23304 my leave of you
23305 Ham You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more
23306 willingly part withal except my life except my life except my
23307 life
23308 Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
23309 Pol Fare you well my lord
23310 Ham These tedious old fools
23311 Pol You go to seek the Lord Hamlet There he is
23312 Ros [to Polonius] God save you sir
23313 Exit [Polonius]
23314 Guil My honour'd lord
23315 Ros My most dear lord
23316 Ham My excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah
23317 Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both
23318 Ros As the indifferent children of the earth
23319 Guil Happy in that we are not overhappy
23320 On Fortune's cap we are not the very button
23321 Ham Nor the soles of her shoe
23322 Ros Neither my lord
23323 Ham Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her
23324 favours
23325 Guil Faith her privates we
23326 Ham In the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a
23327 strumpet What news
23328 Ros None my lord but that the world's grown honest
23329 Ham Then is doomsday near But your news is not true Let me
23330 question more in particular What have you my good friends
23331 deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
23332 hither
23333 Guil Prison my lord
23334 Ham Denmark's a prison
23335 Ros Then is the world one
23336 Ham A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and
23337 dungeons Denmark being one o th worst
23338 Ros We think not so my lord
23339 Ham Why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good
23340 or bad but thinking makes it so To me it is a prison
23341 Ros Why then your ambition makes it one 'Tis too narrow for your
23342 mind
23343 Ham O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
23344 king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams
23345 Guil Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of
23346 the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
23347 Ham A dream itself is but a shadow
23348 Ros Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
23349 it is but a shadow's shadow
23350 Ham Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch'd
23351 heroes the beggars shadows Shall we to th court for by my
23352 fay I cannot reason
23353 Both We'll wait upon you
23354 Ham No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my
23355 servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most
23356 dreadfully attended But in the beaten way of friendship what
23357 make you at Elsinore
23358 Ros To visit you my lord no other occasion
23359 Ham Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you
23360 and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were
23361 you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free
23362 visitation Come deal justly with me Come come Nay speak
23363 Guil What should we say my lord
23364 Ham Why anything but to th purpose You were sent for and
23365 there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties
23366 have not craft enough to colour I know the good King and Queen
23367 have sent for you
23368 Ros To what end my lord
23369 Ham That you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights
23370 of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the
23371 obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a
23372 better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with
23373 me whether you were sent for or no
23374 Ros [aside to Guildenstern] What say you
23375 Ham [aside] Nay then I have an eye of you If you love me hold
23376 not off
23377 Guil My lord we were sent for
23378 Ham I will tell you why So shall my anticipation prevent your
23379 discovery and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
23380 feather I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my
23381 mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so
23382 heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth
23383 seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the
23384 air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical
23385 roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth no other thing
23386 to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours What a
23387 piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in
23388 faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in
23389 action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the
23390 beauty of the world the paragon of animals And yet to me what
23391 is this quintessence of dust Man delights not me no nor woman
23392 neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
23393 Ros My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
23394 Ham Why did you laugh then when I said 'Man delights not me'
23395 Ros To think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten
23396 entertainment the players shall receive from you We coted them
23397 on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
23398 Ham He that plays the king shall be welcome his Majesty shall
23399 have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
23400 target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall
23401 end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
23402 lungs are tickle o th sere and the lady shall say her mind
23403 freely or the blank verse shall halt fort What players are
23404 they
23405 Ros Even those you were wont to take such delight in the
23406 tragedians of the city
23407 Ham How chances it they travel Their residence both in
23408 reputation and profit was better both ways
23409 Ros I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
23410 innovation
23411 Ham Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
23412 city Are they so follow'd
23413 Ros No indeed are they not
23414 Ham How comes it Do they grow rusty
23415 Ros Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is
23416 sir an eyrie of children little eyases that cry out on the top
23417 of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort These are now
23418 the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call
23419 them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
23420 dare scarce come thither
23421 Ham What are they children Who maintains 'em How are they
23422 escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
23423 sing Will they not say afterwards if they should grow
23424 themselves to common players as it is most like if their means
23425 are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
23426 against their own succession
23427 Ros Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation
23428 holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy There was for a
23429 while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
23430 went to cuffs in the question
23431 Ham Is't possible
23432 Guil O there has been much throwing about of brains
23433 Ham Do the boys carry it away
23434 Ros Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too
23435 Ham It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and
23436 those that would make mows at him while my father lived give

23502 Ham I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted
23503 or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleas'd
23504 not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as I
23505 receiv'd it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in
23506 the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes
23507 set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said
23508 there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury
23509 nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
23510 affectation but call'd it an honest method as wholesome as
23511 sweet and by very much more handsome than fine One speech in't
23512 I chiefly lov'd 'Twas AEneas tale to Dido and thereabout of it
23513 especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter If it live in
23514 your memory begin at this line let me see let me see
23515 'The rugged Pyrrhus like th Hyrcanian beast'
23516 'Tis not so it begins with Pyrrhus
23517 'The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms
23518 Black as his purpose did the night resemble
23519 When he lay couched in the ominous horse
23520 Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
23521 With heraldry more dismal Head to foot
23522 Now is be total gules horridly trick'd
23523 With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
23524 Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets
23525 That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
23526 To their lord's murther Roasted in wrath and fire
23527 And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore
23528 With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
23529 Old grandsire Priam seeks'
23530 So proceed you
23531 Pol Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good
23532 discretion
23533 1 Play 'Anon he finds him
23534 Striking too short at Greeks His antique sword
23535 Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
23536 Repugnant to command Unequal match'd
23537 Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
23538 But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
23539 Th unnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium
23540 Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
23541 Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
23542 Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear For lo his sword
23543 Which was declining on the milky head
23544 Of reverend Priam seem'd i th air to stick
23545 So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
23546 And like a neutral to his will and matter
23547 Did nothing
23548 But as we often see against some storm
23549 A silence in the heavens the rack stand still
23550 The bold winds speechless and the orb below
23551 As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
23552 Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pause
23553 Aroused vengeance sets him new awork
23554 And never did the Cyclops hammers fall
23555 On Mars's armour forg'd for proof eterne
23556 With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword
23557 Now falls on Priam
23558 Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
23559 In general synod take away her power
23560 Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
23561 And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
23562 As low as to the fiends
23563 Pol This is too long
23564 Ham It shall to the barber's with your beard Prithee say on
23565 He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to
23566 Hecuba
23567 1 Play 'But who O who had seen the mobled queen'
23568 Ham 'The mobled queen'
23569 Pol That's good 'Mobled queen is good
23570 1 Play 'Run barefoot up and down threat'ning the flames
23571 With bisson rheum a clout upon that head
23572 Where late the diadem stood and for a robe
23573 About her lank and all o'erteemed loins
23574 A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
23575 Who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd
23576 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd
23577 But if the gods themselves did see her then
23578 When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
23579 In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs
23580 The instant burst of clamour that she made
23581 Unless things mortal move them not at all
23582 Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
23583 And passion in the gods'
23584 Pol Look whe'r he has not turn'd his colour and has tears in's
23585 eyes Prithee no more
23586 Ham 'Tis well I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon
23587 Good my lord will you see the players well bestow'd Do you
23588 hear Let them be well us'd for they are the abstract and brief
23589 chronicles of the time After your death you were better have a
23590 bad epitaph than their ill report while you live
23591 Pol My lord I will use them according to their desert
23592 Ham God's bodykins man much better Use every man after his
23593 desert and who should scape whipping Use them after your own
23594 honour and dignity The less they deserve the more merit is in
23595 your bounty Take them in
23596 Pol Come sirs
23597 Ham Follow him friends We'll hear a play tomorrow
23598 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First]
23599 Dost thou hear me old friend Can you play 'The Murther of
23600 Gonzago'
23601 1 Play Ay my lord
23602 Ham We'll ha't tomorrow night You could for a need study a
23603 speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
23604 insert in't could you not
23605 1 Play Ay my lord
23606 Ham Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him not
23607 [Exit First Player]
23608 My good friends I'll leave you till night You are welcome to
23609 Elsinore
23610 Ros Good my lord
23611 Ham Ay so God b wi ye
23612 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
23613 Now I am alone
23614 O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
23615 Is it not monstrous that this player here
23616 But in a fiction in a dream of passion
23617 Could force his soul so to his own conceit
23618 That from her working all his visage wann'd
23619 Tears in his eyes distraction in's aspect
23620 A broken voice and his whole function suiting
23621 With forms to his conceit And all for nothing
23622 For Hecuba
23623 What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
23624 That he should weep for her What would he do
23625 Had he the motive and the cue for passion
23626 That I have He would drown the stage with tears
23627 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
23628 Make mad the guilty and appal the free
23629 Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
23630 The very faculties of eyes and ears
23631 Yet I
23632 A dull and muddymettled rascal peak
23633 Like Johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
23634 And can say nothing No not for a king
23635 Upon whose property and most dear life
23636 A damn'd defeat was made Am I a coward
23637 Who calls me villain breaks my pate across
23638 Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
23639 Tweaks me by th nose gives me the lie i th throat
23640 As deep as to the lungs Who does me this ha
23641 'Swounds I should take it for it cannot be
23642 But I am pigeonliver'd and lack gall
23643 To make oppression bitter or ere this
23644 I should have fatted all the region kites
23645 With this slave's offal Bloody bawdy villain
23646 Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
23647 O vengeance
23648 Why what an ass am I This is most brave
23649 That I the son of a dear father murther'd
23650 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
23651 Must like a whore unpack my heart with words
23652 And fall acursing like a very drab
23653 A scullion
23654 Fie upon't foh About my brain Hum I have heard
23655 That guilty creatures sitting at a play
23656 Have by the very cunning of the scene
23657 Been struck so to the soul that presently
23658 They have proclaim'd their malefactions
23659 For murther though it have no tongue will speak
23660 With most miraculous organ I'll have these Players
23661 Play something like the murther of my father
23662 Before mine uncle I'll observe his looks
23663 I'll tent him to the quick If he but blench
23664 I know my course The spirit that I have seen
23665 May be a devil and the devil hath power
23666 T assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
23667 Out of my weakness and my melancholy
23668 As he is very potent with such spirits
23669 Abuses me to damn me I'll have grounds
23670 More relative than this The play's the thing
23671 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King Exit

23680 ACT III Scene I
23681 Elsinore A room in the Castle
23682 Enter King Queen Polonius Ophelia Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Lords
23683 King And can you by no drift of circumstance
23684 Get from him why he puts on this confusion
23685 Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
23686 With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
23687 Ros He does confess he feels himself distracted
23688 But from what cause he will by no means speak
23689 Guil Nor do we find him forward to be sounded
23690 But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
23691 When we would bring him on to some confession
23692 Of his true state
23693 Queen Did he receive you well
23694 Ros Most like a gentleman
23695 Guil But with much forcing of his disposition
23696 Ros Niggard of question but of our demands
23697 Most free in his reply
23698 Queen Did you assay him
23699 To any pastime
23700 Ros Madam it so fell out that certain players
23701 We o'erraught on the way Of these we told him
23702 And there did seem in him a kind of joy
23703 To hear of it They are here about the court
23704 And as I think they have already order
23705 This night to play before him
23706 Pol 'Tis most true
23707 And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
23708 To hear and see the matter
23709 King With all my heart and it doth much content me
23710 To hear him so inclin'd
23711 Good gentlemen give him a further edge
23712 And drive his purpose on to these delights
23713 Ros We shall my lord
23714 Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
23715 King Sweet Gertrude leave us too
23716 For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
23717 That he as 'twere by accident may here
23718 Affront Ophelia
23719 Her father and myself lawful espials
23720 Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
23721 We may of their encounter frankly judge
23722 And gather by him as he is behav'd
23723 If't be th affliction of his love or no
23724 That thus he suffers for
23725 Queen I shall obey you
23726 And for your part Ophelia I do wish
23727 That your good beauties be the happy cause
23728 Of Hamlet's wildness So shall I hope your virtues
23729 Will bring him to his wonted way again
23730 To both your honours
23731 Oph Madam I wish it may
23732 [Exit Queen]
23733 Pol Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you
23734 We will bestow ourselves [To Ophelia] Read on this book
23735 That show of such an exercise may colour
23736 Your loneliness We are oft to blame in this
23737 'Tis too much prov'd that with devotion's visage
23738 And pious action we do sugar o'er
23739 The Devil himself
23740 King [aside] O 'tis too true
23741 How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
23742 The harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art
23743 Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
23744 Than is my deed to my most painted word
23745 O heavy burthen
23746 Pol I hear him coming Let's withdraw my lord
23747 Exeunt King and Polonius]
23748 Enter Hamlet
23749 Ham To be or not to be that is the question
23750 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
23751 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
23752 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
23753 And by opposing end them To die to sleep
23754 No more and by a sleep to say we end
23755 The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
23756 That flesh is heir to 'Tis a consummation
23757 Devoutly to be wish'd To die to sleep
23758 To sleep perchance to dream ay there's the rub
23759 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
23760 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
23761 Must give us pause There's the respect
23762 That makes calamity of so long life
23763 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
23764 Th oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely
23765 The pangs of despis'd love the law's delay
23766 The insolence of office and the spurns
23767 That patient merit of th unworthy takes
23768 When he himself might his quietus make
23769 With a bare bodkin Who would these fardels bear
23770 To grunt and sweat under a weary life
23771 But that the dread of something after death
23772 The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
23773 No traveller returns puzzles the will
23774 And makes us rather bear those ills we have
23775 Than fly to others that we know not of
23776 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
23777 And thus the native hue of resolution
23778 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
23779 And enterprises of great pith and moment
23780 With this regard their currents turn awry
23781 And lose the name of action Soft you now
23782 The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
23783 Be all my sins rememb'red
23784 Oph Good my lord
23785 How does your honour for this many a day
23786 Ham I humbly thank you well well well
23787 Oph My lord I have remembrances of yours
23788 That I have longed long to redeliver
23789 I pray you now receive them
23790 Ham No not I
23791 I never gave you aught
23792 Oph My honour'd lord you know right well you did
23793 And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
23794 As made the things more rich Their perfume lost
23795 Take these again for to the noble mind
23796 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
23797 There my lord
23798 Ham Ha ha Are you honest
23799 Oph My lord
23800 Ham Are you fair
23801 Oph What means your lordship
23802 Ham That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no
23803 discourse to your beauty
23804 Oph Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
23805 Ham Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
23806 honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
23807 translate beauty into his likeness This was sometime a paradox
23808 but now the time gives it proof I did love you once
23809 Oph Indeed my lord you made me believe so
23810 Ham You should not have believ'd me for virtue cannot so
23811 inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you
23812 not
23813 Oph I was the more deceived
23814 Ham Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
23815 sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse
23816 me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me
23817 I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my
23818 beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give
23819 them shape or time to act them in What should such fellows as I
23820 do crawling between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves all
23821 believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery Where's your
23822 father
23823 Oph At home my lord
23824 Ham Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool
23825 nowhere but in's own house Farewell
23826 Oph O help him you sweet heavens
23827 Ham If thou dost marry I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry
23828 be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape
23829 calumny Get thee to a nunnery Go farewell Or if thou wilt
23830 needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what
23831 monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too
23832 Farewell
23833 Oph O heavenly powers restore him
23834 Ham I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath
23835 given you one face and you make yourselves another You jig you
23836 amble and you lisp you nickname God's creatures and make your
23837 wantonness your ignorance Go to I'll no more on't it hath made
23838 me mad I say we will have no moe marriages Those that are
23839 married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as
23840 they are To a nunnery go Exit
23841 Oph O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
23842 The courtier's scholar's soldier's eye tongue sword
23843 Th expectancy and rose of the fair state
23844 The glass of fashion and the mould of form
23845 Th observ'd of all observers quite quite down
23846 And I of ladies most deject and wretched
23847 That suck'd the honey of his music vows
23848 Now see that noble and most sovereign reason
23849 Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
23850 That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
23851 Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me
23852 T have seen what I have seen see what I see
23853 Enter King and Polonius
23854 King Love his affections do not that way tend
23855 Nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little
23856 Was not like madness There's something in his soul
23857 O'er which his melancholy sits on brood
23858 And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
23859 Will be some danger which for to prevent
23860 I have in quick determination
23861 Thus set it down he shall with speed to England
23862 For the demand of our neglected tribute
23863 Haply the seas and countries different
23864 With variable objects shall expel
23865 This somethingsettled matter in his heart
23866 Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
23867 From fashion of himself What think you on't
23868 Pol It shall do well But yet do I believe
23869 The origin and commencement of his grief
23870 Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
23871 You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
23872 We heard it all My lord do as you please
23873 But if you hold it fit after the play
23874 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
23875 To show his grief Let her be round with him
23876 And I'll be plac'd so please you in the ear
23877 Of all their conference If she find him not
23878 To England send him or confine him where
23879 Your wisdom best shall think
23880 King It shall be so

23882 Scene II
23883 Elsinore hall in the Castle
23884 Enter Hamlet and three of the Players
23885 Ham Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounc'd it to you
23886 trippingly on the tongue But if you mouth it as many of our
23887 players do I had as live the town crier spoke my lines Nor do
23888 not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all
23889 gently for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say
23890 whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a
23891 temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the
23892 soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to
23893 tatters to very rags to split the cars of the groundlings who
23894 for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
23895 shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
23896 Termagant It outherods Herod Pray you avoid it
23897 Player I warrant your honour
23898 Ham Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
23899 tutor Suit the action to the word the word to the action with
23900 this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of
23901 nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing
23902 whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as
23903 'twere the mirror up to nature to show Virtue her own feature
23904 scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his
23905 form and pressure Now this overdone or come tardy off though
23906 it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious
23907 grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance
23908 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others O there be players that I
23909 have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to
23910 speak it profanely that neither having the accent of
23911 Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so
23912 strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
23913 journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated
23914 humanity so abominably
23915 Player I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us sir
23916 Ham O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns
23917 speak no more than is set down for them For there be of them
23918 that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren
23919 spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary
23920 question of the play be then to be considered That's villanous
23921 and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it Go
23922 make you ready
23923 Exeunt Players
23924 Enter Polonius Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
23925 How now my lord Will the King hear this piece of work
23926 Pol And the Queen too and that presently

23935 Hor O my dear lord
23936 Ham Nay do not think I flatter
23937 For what advancement may I hope from thee
23938 That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
23939 To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatter'd
23940 No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
23941 And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
23942 Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
23943 Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
23944 And could of men distinguish her election
23945 Hath scald thee for herself For thou hast been
23946 As one in suff'ring all that suffers nothing
23947 A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
23948 Hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those
23949 Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
23950 That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
23951 To sound what stop she please Give me that man
23952 That is not passion's slave and I will wear him
23953 In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart
23954 As I do thee Something too much of this I
23955 There is a play tonight before the King
23956 One scene of it comes near the circumstance
23957 Which I have told thee of my father's death
23958 I prithee when thou seest that act afoot
23959 Even with the very comment of thy soul
23960 Observe my uncle If his occulted guilt
23961 Do not itself unkennel in one speech
23962 It is a damned ghost that we have seen
23963 And my imaginations are as foul
23964 As Vulcan's stithy Give him heedful note
23965 For I mine eyes will rivet to his face
23966 And after we will both our judgments join
23967 In censure of his seeming

24011 Ham So long Nay then let the devil wear black for I'll have a
24012 suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten
24013 yet Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
24014 half a year But by'r Lady he must build churches then or else

24036 they'll tell all
24037 Oph Will he tell us what this show meant
24038 Ham Ay or any show that you'll show him Be not you asham'd to

24040 Oph You are naught you are naught I'll mark the play
24041 Pro For us and for our tragedy
24042 Here stooping to your clemency
24043 We beg your hearing patiently [Exit]
24044 Ham Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
24045 Oph 'Tis brief my lord
24046 Ham As woman's love
24047 Enter [two Players as] King and Queen
24048 King Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round
24049 Neptune's salt wash and Tellus orbed ground
24050 And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
24051 About the world have times twelve thirties been
24052 Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
24053 Unite comutual in most sacred bands
24054 Queen So many journeys may the sun and moon
24055 Make us again count o'er ere love be done
24056 But woe is me you are so sick of late
24057 So far from cheer and from your former state
24058 That I distrust you Yet though I distrust
24059 Discomfort you my lord it nothing must
24060 For women's fear and love holds quantity
24061 In neither aught or in extremity
24062 Now what my love is proof hath made you know
24063 And as my love is siz'd my fear is so
24064 Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
24065 Where little fears grow great great love grows there
24066 King Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too
24067 My operant powers their functions leave to do
24068 And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
24069 Honour'd belov'd and haply one as kind
24070 For husband shalt thou
24071 Queen O confound the rest
24072 Such love must needs be treason in my breast
24073 When second husband let me be accurst
24074 None wed the second but who killed the first
24075 Ham [aside] Wormwood wormwood
24076 Queen The instances that second marriage move
24077 Are base respects of thrift but none of love
24078 A second time I kill my husband dead
24079 When second husband kisses me in bed
24080 King I do believe you think what now you speak
24081 But what we do determine oft we break
24082 Purpose is but the slave to memory
24083 Of violent birth but poor validity
24084 Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
24085 But fill unshaken when they mellow be
24086 Most necessary 'tis that we forget
24087 To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
24088 What to ourselves in passion we propose
24089 The passion ending doth the purpose lose
24090 The violence of either grief or joy
24091 Their own enactures with themselves destroy
24092 Where joy most revels grief doth most lament
24093 Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
24094 This world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange
24095 That even our loves should with our fortunes change
24096 For 'tis a question left us yet to prove
24097 Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
24098 The great man down you mark his favourite flies
24099 The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies
24100 And hitherto doth love on fortune tend
24101 For who not needs shall never lack a friend
24102 And who in want a hollow friend doth try
24103 Directly seasons him his enemy
24104 But orderly to end where I begun
24105 Our wills and fates do so contrary run
24106 That our devices still are overthrown
24107 Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
24108 So think thou wilt no second husband wed
24109 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
24110 Queen Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
24111 Sport and repose lock from me day and night
24112 To desperation turn my trust and hope
24113 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope
24114 Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
24115 Meet what I would have well and it destroy
24116 Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
24117 If once a widow ever I be wife
24118 Ham If she should break it now
24119 King 'Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
24120 My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
24121 The tedious day with sleep
24122 Queen Sleep rock thy brain
24123 [He] sleeps
24124 And never come mischance between us twain
24125 Exit
24126 Ham Madam how like you this play
24127 Queen The lady doth protest too much methinks
24128 Ham O but she'll keep her word
24129 King Have you heard the argument Is there no offence in't
24130 Ham No no They do but jest poison in jest no offence i th'
24131 world
24132 King What do you call the play
24133 Ham 'The Mousetrap Marry how Tropically This play is the
24134 image of a murther done in Vienna Gonzago is the duke's name

24136 work but what o that Your Majesty and we that have free

24142 Ham I could interpret between you and your love if I could see
24143 the puppets dallying
24144 Oph You are keen my lord you are keen
24145 Ham It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
24146 Oph Still better and worse
24147 Ham So you must take your husbands Begin murtherer Pox leave
24148 thy damnable faces and begin Come the croaking raven doth
24149 bellow for revenge
24150 Luc Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
24151 Confederate season else no creature seeing

24154 Thy natural magic and dire property
24155 On wholesome life usurp immediately
24156 Pours the poison in his ears
24157 Ham He poisons him i th garden for's estate His name's Gonzago
24158 The story is extant and written in very choice Italian You
24159 shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife
24160 Oph The King rises
24161 Ham What frighted with false fire
24162 Queen How fares my lord
24163 Pol Give o'er the play
24164 King Give me some light Away
24165 All Lights lights lights
24166 Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio

24170 Thus runs the world away
24171 Would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my
24172 fortunes turn Turk with mewith two Provincial roses on my raz'd
24173 shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir
24174 Hor Half a share
24175 Ham A whole one I

24177 This realm dismantled was
24178 Of Jove himself and now reigns here
24179 A very very pajock
24180 Hor You might have rhym'd
24181 Ham O good Horatio I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
24182 pound Didst perceive
24183 Hor Very well my lord
24184 Ham Upon the talk of the poisoning
24185 Hor I did very well note him

24196 Ham With drink sir
24197 Guil No my lord rather with choler
24198 Ham Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
24199 the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
24200 plunge him into far more choler
24201 Guil Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start
24202 not so wildly from my affair

24208 If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do
24209 your mother's commandment if not your pardon and my return
24210 shall be the end of my business

24295 Most holy and religious fear it is
24296 To keep those many many bodies safe
24297 That live and feed upon your Majesty
24298 Ros The single and peculiar life is bound
24299 With all the strength and armour of the mind
24300 To keep itself from noyance but much more
24301 That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
24302 The lives of many The cesse of majesty
24303 Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
24304 What's near it with it It is a massy wheel
24305 Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount
24306 To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
24307 Are mortis'd and adjoin'd which when it falls
24308 Each small annexment petty consequence
24309 Attends the boist'rous ruin Never alone
24310 Did the king sigh but with a general groan
24311 King Arm you I pray you to th speedy voyage

24316 Enter Polonius
24317 Pol My lord he's going to his mother's closet
24318 Behind the arras I'll convey myself
24319 To hear the process I'll warrant she'll tax him home
24320 And as you said and wisely was it said
24321 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother
24322 Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear
24323 The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
24324 I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
24325 And tell you what I know

24327 Exit [Polonius]
24328 O my offence is rank it smells to heaven
24329 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't
24330 A brother's murther Pray can I not
24331 Though inclination be as sharp as will
24332 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
24333 And like a man to double business bound
24334 I stand in pause where I shall first begin
24335 And both neglect What if this cursed hand
24336 Were thicker than itself with brother's blood
24337 Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
24338 To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
24339 But to confront the visage of offence
24340 And what's in prayer but this twofold force
24341 To be forestalled ere we come to fall
24342 Or pardon'd being down Then I'll look up
24343 My fault is past But O what form of prayer
24344 Can serve my turn 'Forgive me my foul murther'
24345 That cannot be since I am still possess'd
24346 Of those effects for which I did the murther
24347 My crown mine own ambition and my queen
24348 May one be pardon'd and retain th offence
24349 In the corrupted currents of this world
24350 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice
24351 And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
24352 Buys out the law but 'tis not so above
24353 There is no shuffling there the action lies
24354 In his true nature and we ourselves compell'd
24355 Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
24356 To give in evidence What then What rests
24357 Try what repentance can What can it not
24358 Yet what can it when one cannot repent
24359 O wretched state O bosom black as death
24360 O limed soul that struggling to be free
24361 Art more engag'd Help angels Make assay
24362 Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
24363 Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
24364 All may be well He kneels
24365 Enter Hamlet
24366 Ham Now might I do it pat now he is praying
24367 And now I'll do't And so he goes to heaven
24368 And so am I reveng'd That would be scann'd
24369 A villain kills my father and for that
24370 I his sole son do this same villain send
24371 To heaven
24372 Why this is hire and salary not revenge
24373 He took my father grossly full of bread
24374 With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
24375 And how his audit stands who knows save heaven
24376 But in our circumstance and course of thought
24377 'Tis heavy with him and am I then reveng'd
24378 To take him in the purging of his soul
24379 When he is fit and seasoned for his passage
24380 No
24381 Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
24382 When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
24383 Or in th incestuous pleasure of his bed
24384 At gaming swearing or about some act
24385 That has no relish of salvation in't
24386 Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
24387 And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
24388 As hell whereto it goes My mother stays
24389 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days Exit
24390 King [rises] My words fly up my thoughts remain below
24391 Words without thoughts never to heaven go Exit

24406 Ham Mother you have my father much offended
24407 Queen Come come you answer with an idle tongue
24408 Ham Go go you question with a wicked tongue
24409 Queen Why how now Hamlet
24410 Ham What's the matter now
24411 Queen Have you forgot me
24412 Ham No by the rood not so
24413 You are the Queen your husband's brother's wife
24414 And would it were not so you are my mother
24415 Queen Nay then I'll set those to you that can speak
24416 Ham Come come and sit you down You shall not budge I
24417 You go not till I set you up a glass
24418 Where you may see the inmost part of you
24419 Queen What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murther me
24420 Help help ho
24421 Pol [behind] What ho help help help
24422 Ham [draws] How now a rat Dead for a ducat dead
24423 [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius
24424 Pol [behind] O I am slain
24425 Queen O me what hast thou done
24426 Ham Nay I know not Is it the King
24427 Queen O what a rash and bloody deed is this
24428 Ham A bloody deed almost as bad good mother
24429 As kill a king and marry with his brother
24430 Queen As kill a king
24431 Ham Ay lady it was my word
24432 [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius]
24433 Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
24434 I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune
24435 Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger
24436 Leave wringing of your hinds Peace sit you down
24437 And let me wring your heart for so I shall
24438 If it be made of penetrable stuff
24439 If damned custom have not braz'd it so
24440 That it is proof and bulwark against sense
24441 Queen What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
24442 In noise so rude against me
24443 Ham Such an act
24444 That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
24445 Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
24446 From the fair forehead of an innocent love
24447 And sets a blister there makes marriage vows
24448 As false as dicers oaths O such a deed
24449 As from the body of contraction plucks
24450 The very soul and sweet religion makes
24451 A rhapsody of words Heaven's face doth glow
24452 Yea this solidity and compound mass
24453 With tristful visage as against the doom
24454 Is thoughtsick at the act
24455 Queen Ay me what act
24456 That roars so loud and thunders in the index
24457 Ham Look here upon th's picture and on this
24458 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers
24459 See what a grace was seated on this brow
24460 Hyperion's curls the front of Jove himself
24461 An eye like Mars to threaten and command
24462 A station like the herald Mercury
24463 New lighted on a heavenkissing hill
24464 A combination and a form indeed
24465 Where every god did seem to set his seal
24466 To give the world assurance of a man
24467 This was your husband Look you now what follows
24468 Here is your husband like a mildew'd ear
24469 Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes
24470 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
24471 And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes
24472 You cannot call it love for at your age
24473 The heyday in the blood is tame it's humble
24474 And waits upon the judgment and what judgment
24475 Would step from this to this Sense sure you have
24476 Else could you not have motion but sure that sense
24477 Is apoplex'd for madness would not err
24478 Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
24479 But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
24480 To serve in such a difference What devil was't
24481 That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodmanblind
24482 Eyes without feeling feeling without sight
24483 Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
24484 Or but a sickly part of one true sense
24485 Could not so mope
24486 O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell
24487 If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones
24488 To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
24489 And melt in her own fire Proclaim no shame
24490 When the compulsive ardour gives the charge
24491 Since frost itself as actively doth burn
24492 And reason panders will
24493 Queen O Hamlet speak no more
24494 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul
24495 And there I see such black and grained spots
24496 As will not leave their tinct
24497 Ham Nay but to live
24498 In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
24499 Stew'd in corruption honeying and making love
24500 Over the nasty sty
24501 Queen O speak to me no more
24502 These words like daggers enter in mine ears
24503 No more sweet Hamlet
24504 Ham A murtherer and a villain
24505 A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
24506 Of your precedent lord a vice of kings
24507 A cutpurse of the empire and the rule
24508 That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
24509 And put it in his pocket
24510 Queen No more
24511 Enter the Ghost in his nightgown
24512 Ham A king of shreds and patches
24513 Save me and hover o'er me with your wings
24514 You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure
24515 Queen Alas he's mad
24516 Ham Do you not come your tardy son to chide
24517 That laps'd in time and passion lets go by
24518 Th important acting of your dread command
24519 O say
24520 Ghost Do not forget This visitation
24521 Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
24522 But look amazement on thy mother sits
24523 O step between her and her fighting soul
24524 Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
24525 Speak to her Hamlet
24526 Ham How is it with you lady
24527 Queen Alas how is't with you
24528 That you do bend your eye on vacancy
24529 And with th encorporal air do hold discourse
24530 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
24531 And as the sleeping soldiers in th alarm
24532 Your bedded hairs like life in excrements
24533 Start up and stand an end O gentle son
24534 Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
24535 Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look
24536 Ham On him on him Look you how pale he glares
24537 His form and cause conjoin'd preaching to stones
24538 Would make them capable Do not look upon me
24539 Lest with this piteous action you convert
24540 My stern effects Then what I have to do
24541 Will want true colour tears perchance for blood
24542 Queen To whom do you speak this
24543 Ham Do you see nothing there
24544 Queen Nothing at all yet all that is I see
24545 Ham Nor did you nothing hear
24546 Queen No nothing but ourselves
24547 Ham Why look you there Look how it steals away
24548 My father in his habit as he liv'd
24549 Look where he goes even now out at the portal
24550 Exit Ghost
24551 Queen This is the very coinage of your brain
24552 This bodiless creation ecstasy
24553 Is very cunning in
24554 Ham Ecstasy
24555 My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
24556 And makes as healthful music It is not madness
24557 That I have utt'red Bring me to the test
24558 And I the matter will reword which madness
24559 Would gambol from Mother for love of grace
24560 Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
24561 That not your trespass but my madness speaks
24562 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place
24563 Whiles rank corruption mining all within
24564 Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven
24565 Repent what's past avoid what is to come
24566 And do not spread the compost on the weeds
24567 To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue
24568 For in the fatness of these pursy times
24569 Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
24570 Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
24571 Queen O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
24572 Ham O throw away the worser part of it
24573 And live the purer with the other half
24574 Good night but go not to my uncle's bed
24575 Assume a virtue if you have it not
24576 That monster custom who all sense doth eat
24577 Of habits evil is angel yet in this
24578 That to the use of actions fair and good
24579 He likewise gives a frock or livery
24580 That aptly is put on Refrain tonight
24581 And that shall lend a kind of easiness
24582 To the next abstinence the next more easy
24583 For use almost can change the stamp of nature
24584 And either [master] the devil or throw him out
24585 With wondrous potency Once more good night
24586 And when you are desirous to be blest
24587 I'll blessing beg of you For this same lord
24588 I do repent but heaven hath pleas'd it so
24589 To punish me with this and this with me
24590 That I must be their scourge and minister
24591 I will bestow him and will answer well
24592 The death I gave him So again good night
24593 I must be cruel only to be kind
24594 Thus bad begins and worse remains behind
24595 One word more good lady
24596 Queen What shall I do
24597 Ham Not this by no means that I bid you do
24598 Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed
24599 Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
24600 And let him for a pair of reechy kisses
24601 Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers
24602 Make you to ravel all this matter out
24603 That I essentially am not in madness
24604 But mad in craft 'Twere good you let him know
24605 For who that's but a queen fair sober wise
24606 Would from a paddock from a bat a gib
24607 Such dear concernings hide Who would do so
24608 No in despite of sense and secrecy
24609 Unpeg the basket on the house's top
24610 Let the birds fly and like the famous ape
24611 To try conclusions in the basket creep
24612 And break your own neck down
24613 Queen Be thou assur'd if words be made of breath
24614 And breath of life I have no life to breathe
24615 What thou hast said to me
24616 Ham I must to England you know that
24617 Queen Alack
24618 I had forgot 'Tis so concluded on
24619 Ham There's letters seal'd and my two schoolfellows
24620 Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd
24621 They bear the mandate they must sweep my way
24622 And marshal me to knavery Let it work
24623 For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
24624 Hoist with his own petar and 't shall go hard
24625 But I will delve one yard below their mines
24626 And blow them at the moon O 'tis most sweet
24627 When in one line two crafts directly meet
24628 This man shall set me packing
24629 I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room
24630 Mother good night Indeed this counsellor
24631 Is now most still most secret and most grave
24632 Who was in life a foolish peating knave
24633 Come sir to draw toward an end with you
24634 Good night mother
24635 [Exit the Queen Then] Exit Hamlet tugging in
24636 Polonius

24656 Which is the mightier In his lawless fit
24657 Behind the arras hearing something stir

24659 And in this brainish apprehension kills
24660 The unseen good old man
24661 King O heavy deed
24662 It had been so with us had we been there
24663 His liberty is full of threats to all
24664 To you yourself to us to every one
24665 Alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd
24666 It will be laid to us whose providence
24667 Should have kept short restrain'd and out of haunt
24668 This mad young man But so much was our love
24669 We would not understand what was most fit
24670 But like the owner of a foul disease
24671 To keep it from divulging let it feed
24672 Even on the pith of life Where is he gone
24673 Queen To draw apart the body he hath kill'd
24674 O'er whom his very madness like some ore
24675 Among a mineral of metals base

24690 And let them know both what we mean to do
24691 And what's untimely done [So haply slander]
24692 Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter
24693 As level as the cannon to his blank
24694 Transports his poisoned shot may miss our name
24695 And hit the woundless air O come away

24713 of a king
24714 Ros Take you me for a sponge my lord

24737 Who like not in their judgment but their eyes
24738 And where 'tis so th offender's scourge is weigh'd
24739 But never the offence To bear all smooth and even

24858 If his chief good and market of his time
24859 Be but to sleep and feed A beast no more
24860 Sure he that made us with such large discourse
24861 Looking before and after gave us not
24862 That capability and godlike reason
24863 To fust in us unus'd Now whether it be
24864 Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
24865 Of thinking too precisely on th event
24866 A thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom
24867 And ever three parts coward I do not know
24868 Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do'
24869 Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
24870 To do't Examples gross as earth exhort me
24871 Witness this army of such mass and charge
24872 Led by a delicate and tender prince
24873 Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
24874 Makes mouths at the invisible event
24875 Exposing what is mortal and unsure
24876 To all that fortune death and danger dare
24877 Even for an eggshell Rightly to be great
24878 Is not to stir without great argument
24879 But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
24880 When honour's at the stake How stand I then
24881 That have a father klll'd a mother stain'd
24882 Excitements of my reason and my blood
24883 And let all sleep while to my shame I see
24884 The imminent death of twenty thousand men
24885 That for a fantasy and trick of fame
24886 Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
24887 Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
24888 Which is not tomb enough and continent
24889 To hide the slain O from this time forth
24890 My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth Exit

24910 Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
24911 The hearers to collection they aim at it
24912 And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts

24918 Queen Let her come in

25012 And as the world were now but to begin
25013 Antiquity forgot custom not known

25071 And am most sensibly in grief for it
25072 It shall as level to your judgment pierce
25073 As day does to your eye
25074 A noise within 'Let her come in'
25075 Laer How now What noise is that
25076 Enter Ophelia
25077 O heat dry up my brains Tears seven times salt
25078 Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
25079 By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
25080 Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May
25081 Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
25082 O heavens is't possible a young maid's wits
25083 Should be as mortal as an old man's life
25084 Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine
25085 It sends some precious instance of itself
25086 After the thing it loves
25087 Oph sings
25088 They bore him barefac'd on the bier
25089 Hey non nony nony hey nony
25090 And in his grave rain'd many a tear
25091 Fare you well my dove
25092 Laer Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
25093 It could not move thus
25094 Oph You must sing 'Adown adown and you call him adowna O
25095 how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward that stole his
25096 master's daughter
25097 Laer This nothing's more than matter

25100 Laer A document in madness Thoughts and remembrance fitted
25101 Oph There's fennel for you and columbines There's rue for you
25102 and here's some for me We may call it herb of grace o Sundays
25103 O you must wear your rue with a difference There's a daisy I
25104 would give you some violets but they wither'd all when my father
25105 died They say he made a good end
25106 [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy
25107 Laer Thought and affliction passion hell itself
25108 She turns to favour and to prettiness
25109 Oph sings
25110 And will he not come again
25111 And will he not come again
25112 No no he is dead
25113 Go to thy deathbed
25114 He never will come again
25115 His beard was as white as snow
25116 All flaxen was his poll

25127 If by direct or by collateral hand
25128 They find us touch'd we will our kingdom give
25129 Our crown our life and all that we call ours
25130 To you in satisfaction but if not
25131 Be you content to lend your patience to us

25193 Scene VII
25194 Elsinore Another room in the Castle
25195 Enter King and Laertes
25196 King Now must your conscience my acquittance seal
25197 And You must put me in your heart for friend
25198 Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
25199 That he which hath your noble father slain
25200 Pursued my life
25201 Laer It well appears But tell me
25202 Why you proceeded not against these feats
25203 So crimeful and so capital in nature
25204 As by your safety wisdom all things else
25205 You mainly were stirr'd up
25206 King O for two special reasons
25207 Which may to you perhaps seein much unsinew'd
25208 But yet to me they are strong The Queen his mother
25209 Lives almost by his looks and for myself
25210 My virtue or my plague be it either which
25211 She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
25212 That as the star moves not but in his sphere
25213 I could not but by her The other motive
25214 Why to a public count I might not go
25215 Is the great love the general gender bear him
25216 Who dipping all his faults in their affection
25217 Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
25218 Convert his gives to graces so that my arrows
25219 Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind
25220 Would have reverted to my bow again
25221 And not where I had aim'd them
25222 Laer And so have I a noble father lost
25223 A sister driven into desp'rate terms
25224 Whose worth if praises may go back again
25225 Stood challenger on mount of all the age
25226 For her perfections But my revenge will come
25227 King Break not your sleeps for that You must not think
25228 That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
25229 That we can let our beard be shook with danger
25230 And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more
25231 I lov'd your father and we love ourself
25232 And that I hope will teach you to imagine
25233 Enter a Messenger with letters
25234 How now What news
25235 Mess Letters my lord from Hamlet
25236 This to your Majesty this to the Queen
25237 King From Hamlet Who brought them
25238 Mess Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
25239 They were given me by Claudio he receiv'd them
25240 Of him that brought them
25241 King Laertes you shall hear them
25242 Leave us
25243 Exit Messenger
25244 [Reads]'High and MightyYou shall know I am set naked on your
25245 kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes
25246 when I shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the
25247 occasion of my sudden and more strange return
25248 'HAMLET'
25249 What should this mean Are all the rest come back
25250 Or is it some abuse and no such thing
25251 Laer Know you the hand
25252 King 'Tis Hamlet's character 'Naked'
25253 And in a postscript here he says 'alone'
25254 Can you advise me
25255 Laer I am lost in it my lord But let him come
25256 It warms the very sickness in my heart
25257 That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
25258 'Thus didest thou'
25259 King If it be so Laertes
25260 As how should it be so how otherwise
25261 Will you be rul'd by me
25262 Laer Ay my lord
25263 So you will not o'errule me to a peace
25264 King To thine own peace If he be now return'd
25265 As checking at his voyage and that he means
25266 No more to undertake it I will work him
25267 To exploit now ripe in my device
25268 Under the which he shall not choose but fall
25269 And for his death no wind
25270 But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
25271 And call it accident
25272 Laer My lord I will be rul'd
25273 The rather if you could devise it so
25274 That I might be the organ
25275 King It falls right
25276 You have been talk'd of since your travel much
25277 And that in Hamlet's hearing for a quality
25278 Wherein they say you shine Your sun of parts
25279 Did not together pluck such envy from him
25280 As did that one and that in my regard
25281 Of the unworthiest siege
25282 Laer What part is that my lord
25283 King A very riband in the cap of youth
25284 Yet needfull too for youth no less becomes
25285 The light and careless livery that it wears
25286 Thin settled age his sables and his weeds
25287 Importing health and graveness Two months since
25288 Here was a gentleman of Normandy
25289 I have seen myself and serv'd against the French
25290 And they can well on horseback but this gallant
25291 Had witchcraft in't He grew unto his seat
25292 And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
25293 As had he been incorps'd and deminatur'd
25294 With the brave beast So far he topp'd my thought
25295 That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
25296 Come short of what he did
25297 Laer A Norman was't
25298 King A Norman
25299 Laer Upon my life Lamound
25300 King The very same
25301 Laer I know him well He is the broach indeed
25302 And gem of all the nation
25303 King He made confession of you
25304 And gave you such a masterly report
25305 For art and exercise in your defence
25306 And for your rapier most especially
25307 That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
25308 If one could match you The scrimers of their nation
25309 He swore had neither motion guard nor eye
25310 If you oppos'd them Sir this report of his
25311 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
25312 That he could nothing do but wish and beg
25313 Your sudden coming o'er to play with you
25314 Now out of this
25315 Laer What out of this my lord
25316 King Laertes was your father dear to you
25317 Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
25318 A face without a heart'
25319 Laer Why ask you this
25320 King Not that I think you did not love your father
25321 But that I know love is begun by time
25322 And that I see in passages of proof
25323 Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
25324 There lives within the very flame of love
25325 A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
25326 And nothing is at a like goodness still
25327 For goodness growing to a plurisy
25328 Dies in his own toomuch That we would do
25329 We should do when we would for this 'would changes
25330 And hath abatements and delays as many
25331 As there are tongues are hands are accidents
25332 And then this 'should is like a spendthrift sigh
25333 That hurts by easing But to the quick o th ulcer
25334 Hamlet comes back What would you undertake
25335 To show yourself your father's son in deed
25336 More than in words
25337 Laer To cut his throat i th church
25338 King No place indeed should murther sanctuarize
25339 Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
25340 Will you do this Keep close within your chamber
25341 Will return'd shall know you are come home
25342 We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
25343 And set a double varnish on the fame
25344 The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
25345 And wager on your heads He being remiss
25346 Most generous and free from all contriving
25347 Will not peruse the foils so that with ease
25348 Or with a little shuffling you may choose
25349 A sword unbated and in a pass of practice
25350 Requite him for your father
25351 Laer I will do't
25352 And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword
25353 I bought an unction of a mountebank
25354 So mortal that but dip a knife in it
25355 Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
25356 Collected from all simples that have virtue
25357 Under the moon can save the thing from death
25358 This is but scratch'd withal I'll touch my point
25359 With this contagion that if I gall him slightly
25360 It may be death
25361 King Let's further think of this
25362 Weigh what convenience both of time and means
25363 May fit us to our shape If this should fall
25364 And that our drift look through our bad performance
25365 'Twere better not assay'd Therefore this project
25366 Should have a back or second that might hold
25367 If this did blast in proof Soft let me see
25368 We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings
25369 I ha't
25370 When in your motion you are hot and dry
25371 As make your bouts more violent to that end
25372 And that he calls for drink I'll have prepar'd him
25373 A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
25374 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck
25375 Our purpose may hold there But stay what noise
25376 Enter Queen
25377 How now sweet queen
25378 Queen One woe doth tread upon another's heel
25379 So fast they follow Your sister's drown'd Laertes
25380 Laer Drown'd O where
25381 Queen There is a willow grows aslant a brook
25382 That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
25383 There with fantastic garlands did she come
25384 Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
25385 That liberal shepherds give a grosser name
25386 But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them
25387 There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
25388 Clamb'ring to hang an envious sliver broke
25389 When down her weedy trophies and herself
25390 Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
25391 And mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
25392 Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes
25393 As one incapable of her own distress
25394 Or like a creature native and indued
25395 Unto that element but long it could not be
25396 Till that her garments heavy with their drink
25397 Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
25398 To muddy death
25399 Laer Alas then she is drown'd
25400 Queen Drown'd drown'd
25401 Laer Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
25402 And therefore I forbid my tears but yet
25403 It is our trick nature her custom holds
25404 Let shame say what it will When these are gone
25405 The woman will be out Adieu my lord
25406 I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
25407 But that this folly douts it Exit
25408 King Let's follow Gertrude
25409 How much I had to do to calm his rage I
25410 Now fear I this will give it start again
25411 Therefore let's follow
25412 Exeunt

25487 Ham 'Tis e'en so The hand of little employment hath the daintier
25488 sense
25489 Clown sings
25490 But age with his stealing steps

25492 And hath shipped me intil the land
25493 As if I had never been such
25494 [Throws up a skull]
25495 Ham That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once How the
25496 knave jowls it to the groundas if 'twere Cain's jawbone that
25497 did the first murther This might be the pate of a Politician
25498 which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent God
25499 might it not
25500 Hor It might my lord
25501 Ham Or of a courtier which could say 'Good morrow sweet lord

25519 and his tricks Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
25520 him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him
25521 of his action of battery Hum This fellow might be in's time a
25522 great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his
25523 fines his double vouchers his recoveries Is this the fine of
25524 his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
25525 pate full of fine dirt Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
25526 his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth
25527 of a pair of indentures The very conveyances of his lands will
25528 scarcely lie in this box and must th inheritor himself have no
25529 more ha
25530 Hor Not a jot more my lord

25550 Ham How absolute the knave is We must speak by the card or
25551 equivocation will undo us By the Lord Horatio this three years
25552 I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe
25553 of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
25554 his kibe How long hast thou been a gravemaker
25555 Clown Of all the days i th year I came to't that day that our

25577 will last you some eight year or nine year A tanner will last
25578 you nine year
25579 Ham Why he more than another

25593 Horatio A fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy He
25594 hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes And now how abhorred
25595 in my imagination it is My gorge rises at it Here hung those
25596 lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft Where be your gibes
25597 now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that
25598 were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your

25609 Ham To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may not
25610 imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
25611 stopping a bunghole
25612 Hor 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so
25613 Ham No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty
25614 enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died
25615 Alexander was buried Alexander returneth into dust the dust is
25616 earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
25617 was converted might they not stop a beer barrel
25618 Imperious Caesar dead and turn'd to clay
25619 Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
25620 O that that earth which kept the world in awe
25621 Should patch a wall t expel the winter's flaw
25622 But soft but soft aside Here comes the King

25635 Priest Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
25636 As we have warranty Her death was doubtful
25637 And but that great command o'ersways the order
25638 She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
25639 Till the last trumpet For charitable prayers
25640 Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
25641 Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants
25642 Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
25643 Of bell and burial
25644 Laer Must there no more be done
25645 Priest No more be done

25647 To sing a requiem and such rest to her
25648 As to peaceparted souls

25650 And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

25665 Leaps in the grave
25666 Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
25667 Till of this flat a mountain you have made
25668 T o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
25669 Of blue Olympus
25670 Ham [comes forward] What is he whose grief
25671 Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
25672 Conjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand
25673 Like wonderwounded hearers This is I
25674 Hamlet the Dane [Leaps in after Laertes
25675 Laer The devil take thy soul
25676 [Grapples with him]
25677 Ham Thou pray'st not well
25678 I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
25679 For though I am not splenitive and rash
25680 Yet have I in me something dangerous
25681 Which let thy wisdom fear Hold off thy hand
25682 King Pluck thein asunder
25683 Queen Hamlet Hamlet

25688 Ham Why I will fight with him upon this theme
25689 Until my eyelids will no longer wag
25690 Queen O my son what theme
25691 Ham I lov'd Ophelia Forty thousand brothers
25692 Could not with all their quantity of love
25693 Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her
25694 King O he is mad Laertes
25695 Queen For love of God forbear him
25696 Ham 'Swounds show me what thou't do
25697 Woo't weep woo't fight woo't fast woo't tear thyself
25698 Woo't drink up esill eat a crocodile
25699 I'll do't Dost thou come here to whine
25700 To outface me with leaping in her grave
25701 Be buried quick with her and so will I
25702 And if thou prate of mountains let them throw
25703 Millions of acres on us till our ground
25704 Singeing his pate against the burning zone
25705 Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thou'lt mouth
25706 I'll rant as well as thou
25707 Queen This is mere madness
25708 And thus a while the fit will work on him
25709 Anon as patient as the female dove
25710 When that her golden couplets are disclos'd
25711 His silence will sit drooping
25712 Ham Hear you sir
25713 What is the reason that you use me thus
25714 I lov'd you ever But it is no matter
25715 Let Hercules himself do what he may

25724 An hour of quiet shortly shall we see
25725 Till then in patience our proceeding be
25726 Exeunt
25727 Scene II
25728 Elsinore A hall in the Castle
25729 Enter Hamlet and Horatio
25730 Ham So much for this sir now shall you see the other
25731 You do remember all the circumstance
25732 Hor Remember it my lord
25733 Ham Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
25734 That would not let me sleep Methought I lay
25735 Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes Rashly
25736 And prais'd be rashness for it let us know
25737 Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
25738 When our deep plots do pall and that should learn us
25739 There's a divinity that shapes our ends
25740 Roughhew them how we will
25741 Hor That is most certain
25742 Ham Up from my cabin
25743 My seagown scarf'd about me in the dark
25744 Grop'd I to find out them had my desire
25745 Finger'd their packet and in fine withdrew
25746 To mine own room again making so bold
25747 My fears forgetting manners to unseal
25748 Their grand commission where I found Horatio
25749 O royal knavery an exact command
25750 Larded with many several sorts of reasons
25751 Importing Denmark's health and England's too
25752 With hoo such bugs and goblins in my life
25753 That on the supervise no leisure bated
25754 No not to stay the finding of the axe
25755 My head should be struck off
25756 Hor Is't possible
25757 Ham Here's the commission read it at more leisure
25758 But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed
25759 Hor I beseech you
25760 Ham Being thus benetted round with villanies
25761 Or I could make a prologue to my brains
25762 They had begun the play I sat me down
25763 Devis'd a new commission wrote it fair
25764 I once did hold it as our statists do
25765 A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
25766 How to forget that learning but sir now
25767 It did me yeoman's service Wilt thou know
25768 Th effect of what I wrote
25769 Hor Ay good my lord
25770 Ham An earnest conjuration from the King
25771 As England was his faithful tributary
25772 As love between them like the palm might flourish
25773 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
25774 And stand a comma 'tween their amities
25775 And many suchlike as's of great charge
25776 That on the view and knowing of these contents
25777 Without debatement further more or less
25778 He should the bearers put to sudden death
25779 Not shriving time allow'd
25780 Hor How was this seal'd
25781 Ham Why even in that was heaven ordinant
25782 I had my father's signet in my purse
25783 which was the model of that Danish seal
25784 Folded the writ up in the form of th other
25785 Subscrib'd it gave't th impression plac'd it safely
25786 The changeling never known Now the next day
25787 Was our seafight and what to this was sequent
25788 Thou know'st already
25789 Hor So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't
25790 Ham Why man they did make love to this employment
25791 They are not near my conscience their defeat
25792 Does by their own insinuation grow
25793 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
25794 Between the pass and fell incensed points
25795 Of mighty opposites
25796 Hor Why what a king is this
25797 Ham Does it not thinks't thee stand me now upon
25798 He that hath kill'd my king and whor'd my mother
25799 Popp'd in between th election and my hopes
25800 Thrown out his angle for my Proper life
25801 And with such coz'nage is't not perfect conscience
25802 To quit him with this arm And is't not to be damn'd
25803 To let this canker of our nature come
25804 In further evil
25805 Hor It must be shortly known to him from England
25806 What is the issue of the business there
25807 Ham It will be short the interim is mine
25808 And a man's life is no more than to say 'one'
25809 But I am very sorry good Horatio
25810 That to Laertes I forgot myself
25811 For by the image of my cause I see
25812 The portraiture of his I'll court his favours
25813 But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
25814 Into a tow'ring passion
25815 Hor Peace Who comes here
25816 Enter young Osric a courtier
25817 Osr Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
25818 Ham I humbly thank you sir [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
25819 waterfly
25820 Hor [aside to Hamlet] No my good lord
25821 Ham [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a
25822 vice to know him He hath much land and fertile Let a beast be
25823 lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'Tis
25824 a chough but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt
25825 Osr Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart
25826 a thing to you from his Majesty
25827 Ham I will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit Put your
25828 bonnet to his right use 'Tis for the head
25829 Osr I thank your lordship it is very hot
25830 Ham No believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly
25831 Osr It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
25832 Ham But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
25833 Osr Exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as 'twere I cannot
25834 tell how But my lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that
25835 he has laid a great wager on your head Sir this is the matter
25836 Ham I beseech you remember
25837 [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat]
25838 Osr Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith Sir here is
25839 newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman
25840 full of most excellent differences of very soft society and
25841 great showing Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card
25842 or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of
25843 what part a gentleman would see
25844 Ham Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I
25845 know to divide him inventorially would dozy th arithmetic of
25846 memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
25847 But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great
25848 article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make
25849 true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else
25850 would trace him his umbrage nothing more
25851 Osr Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
25852 Ham The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
25853 rawer breath
25854 Osr Sir
25855 Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
25856 tongue You will do't sir really
25857 Ham What imports the nomination of this gentleman
25858 Osr Of Laertes
25859 Hor [aside] His purse is empty already All's golden words are
25860 spent
25861 Ham Of him sir
25862 Osr I know you are not ignorant
25863 Ham I would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
25864 much approve me Well sir
25865 Osr You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is
25866 Ham I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in
25867 excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
25868 Osr I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him
25869 by them in his meed he's unfellowed
25870 Ham What's his weapon
25871 Osr Rapier and dagger
25872 Ham That's two of his weapons but well
25873 Osr The King sir hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses
25874 against the which he has impon'd as I take it six French
25875 rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and
25876 so Three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy
25877 very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of
25878 very liberal conceit
25879 Ham What call you the carriages
25880 Hor [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
25881 ere you had done
25882 Osr The carriages sir are the hangers
25883 Ham The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
25884 carry cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then
25885 But on Six Barbary horses against six French swords their
25886 assigns and three liberalconceited carriages that's the French
25887 bet against the Danish Why is this all impon'd as you call it
25888 Osr The King sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between
25889 yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath
25890 laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial
25891 if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
25892 Ham How if I answer no
25893 Osr I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
25894 Ham Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his Majesty
25895 it is the breathing time of day with me Let the foils be
25896 brought the gentleman willing and the King hold his purpose
25897 I will win for him if I can if not I will gain nothing but my
25898 shame and the odd hits
25899 Osr Shall I redeliver you e'en so
25900 Ham To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
25901 Osr I commend my duty to your lordship
25902 Ham Yours yours [Exit Osric] He does well to commend it
25903 himself there are no tongues else for's turn
25904 Hor This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
25905 Ham He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it Thus has he
25906 and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
25907 on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter
25908 a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and
25909 through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions and do but blow
25910 them to their trialthe bubbles are out
25911 Enter a Lord
25912 Lord My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who
25913 brings back to him that you attend him in the hall He sends to
25914 know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will
25915 take longer time
25916 Ham I am constant to my purposes they follow the King's pleasure
25917 If his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided
25918 I be so able as now
25919 Lord The King and Queen and all are coming down
25920 Ham In happy time
25921 Lord The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
25922 Laertes before you fall to play
25923 Ham She well instructs me
25924 [Exit Lord]
25925 Hor You will lose this wager my lord
25926 Ham I do not think so Since he went into France I have been in
25927 continual practice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not
25928 think how ill all's here about my heart But it is no matter
25929 Hor Nay good my lord
25930 Ham It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
25931 would perhaps trouble a woman
25932 Hor If your mind dislike anything obey it I will forestall their
25933 repair hither and say you are not fit
25934 Ham Not a whit we defy augury there's a special providence in
25935 the fall of a sparrow If it be now 'tis not to come if it be
25936 not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
25937 the readiness is all Since no man knows aught of what he leaves
25938 what is't to leave betimes Let be
25939 Enter King Queen Laertes Osric and Lords with other
25940 Attendants with foils and gauntlets
25941 A table and flagons of wine on it
25942 King Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
25943 [The King puts Laertes hand into Hamlet's]
25944 Ham Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong
25945 But pardon't as you are a gentleman
25946 This presence knows
25947 And you must needs have heard how I am punish'd
25948 With sore distraction What I have done
25949 That might your nature honour and exception
25950 Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
25951 Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes Never Hamlet
25952 If Hamlet from himself be taken away
25953 And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes
25954 Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
25955 Who does it then His madness If't be so
25956 Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd
25957 His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy
25958 Sir in this audience
25959 Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
25960 Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
25961 That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
25962 And hurt my brother
25963 Laer I am satisfied in nature
25964 Whose motive in this case should stir me most
25965 To my revenge But in my terms of honour
25966 I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
25967 Till by some elder masters of known honour
25968 I have a voice and precedent of peace
25969 To keep my name ungor'd But till that time
25970 I do receive your offer'd love like love
25971 And will not wrong it
25972 Ham I embrace it freely
25973 And will this brother's wager frankly play
25974 Give us the foils Come on
25975 Laer Come one for me
25976 Ham I'll be your foil Laertes In mine ignorance
25977 Your skill shall like a star i th darkest night
25978 Stick fiery off indeed
25979 Laer You mock me sir
25980 Ham No by this bad
25981 King Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet
25982 You know the wager
25983 Ham Very well my lord
25984 Your Grace has laid the odds o th weaker side
25985 King I do not fear it I have seen you both
25986 But since he is better'd we have therefore odds
25987 Laer This is too heavy let me see another
25988 Ham This likes me well These foils have all a length
25989 Prepare to play
25990 Osr Ay my good lord
25991 King Set me the stoups of wine upon that table
25992 If Hamlet give the first or second hit
25993 Or quit in answer of the third exchange
25994 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
25995 The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath
25996 And in the cup an union shall he throw
25997 Richer than that which four successive kings
25998 In Denmark's crown have worn Give me the cups
25999 And let the kettle to the trumpet speak
26000 The trumpet to the cannoneer without
26001 The cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth
26002 'Now the King drinks to Hamlet Come begin
26003 And you the judges bear a wary eye
26004 Ham Come on sir
26005 Laer Come my lord They play
26006 Ham One
26007 Laer No
26008 Ham Judgment
26009 Osr A hit a very palpable hit
26010 Laer Well again
26011 King Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine
26012 Here's to thy health
26013 [Drum trumpets sound a piece goes off [within]
26014 Give him the cup
26015 Ham I'll play this bout first set it by awhile
26016 Come They play Another hit What say you
26017 Laer A touch a touch I do confess't
26018 King Our son shall win
26019 Queen He's fat and scant of breath
26020 Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
26021 The Queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet
26022 Ham Good madam
26023 King Gertrude do not drink
26024 Queen I will my lord I pray you pardon me Drinks
26025 King [aside] It is the poison'd cup it is too late
26026 Ham I dare not drink yet madam byandby
26027 Queen Come let me wipe thy face
26028 Laer My lord I'll hit him now
26029 King I do not think't
26030 Laer [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience
26031 Ham Come for the third Laertes You but dally
26032 pray You Pass with your best violence
26033 I am afeard You make a wanton of me
26034 Laer Say you so Come on Play
26035 Osr Nothing neither way
26036 Laer Have at you now
26037 [Laertes wounds Hamlet then] in scuffling they
26038 change rapiers [and Hamlet wounds Laertes]
26039 King Part them They are incens'd
26040 Ham Nay come again The Queen falls
26041 Osr Look to the Queen there ho
26042 Hor They bleed on both sides How is it my lord
26043 Osr How is't Laertes
26044 Laer Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
26045 I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery
26046 Ham How does the Queen
26047 King She sounds to see them bleed
26048 Queen No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet
26049 The drink the drink I am poison'd [Dies]
26050 Ham O villany Ho let the door be lock'd
26051 Treachery Seek it out
26052 [Laertes falls]
26053 Laer It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain
26054 No medicine in the world can do thee good
26055 In thee there is not half an hour of life
26056 The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
26057 Unbated and envenom'd The foul practice
26058 Hath turn'd itself on me Lo here I lie
26059 Never to rise again Thy mother's poison'd
26060 I can no more The King the King's to blame
26061 Ham The point envenom'd too
26062 Then venom to thy work Hurts the King
26063 All Treason treason
26064 King O yet defend me friends I am but hurt
26065 Ham Here thou incestuous murd'rous damned Dane
26066 Drink off this potion Is thy union here
26067 Follow my mother King dies
26068 Laer He is justly serv'd
26069 It is a poison temper'd by himself
26070 Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
26071 Mine and my father's death come not upon thee
26072 Nor thine on me Dies
26073 Ham Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee
26074 I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu
26075 You that look pale and tremble at this chance
26076 That are but mutes or audience to this act
26077 Had I but time as this fell sergeant Death
26078 Is strict in his arrest O I could tell you
26079 But let it be Horatio I am dead
26080 Thou liv'st report me and my cause aright
26081 To the unsatisfied
26082 Hor Never believe it
26083 I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
26084 Here's yet some liquor left
26085 Ham As th'art a man
26086 Give me the cup Let go By heaven I'll ha't
26087 O good Horatio what a wounded name
26088 Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
26089 If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
26090 Absent thee from felicity awhile
26091 And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
26092 To tell my story [March afar off and shot within]
26093 What warlike noise is this
26094 Osr Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland
26095 To the ambassadors of England gives
26096 This warlike volley
26097 Ham O I die Horatio
26098 The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
26099 I cannot live to hear the news from England
26100 But I do prophesy th election lights
26101 On Fortinbras He has my dying voice
26102 So tell him with th occurrents more and less
26103 Which have solicited the rest is silence Dies
26104 Hor Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince
26105 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
26106 [March within]
26107 Why does the drum come hither
26108 Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors with Drum
26109 Colours and Attendants
26110 Fort Where is this sight
26111 Hor What is it you will see
26112 If aught of woe or wonder cease your search
26113 Fort This quarry cries on havoc O proud Death
26114 What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
26115 That thou so many princes at a shot
26116 So bloodily hast struck
26117 Ambassador The sight is dismal
26118 And our affairs from England come too late
26119 The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
26120 To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
26121 That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
26122 Where should We have our thanks
26123 Hor Not from his mouth
26124 Had it th ability of life to thank you
26125 He never gave commandment for their death
26126 But since so jump upon this bloody question
26127 You from the Polack wars and you from England
26128 Are here arriv'd give order that these bodies
26129 High on a stage be placed to the view
26130 And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
26131 How these things came about So shall You hear
26132 Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
26133 Of accidental judgments casual slaughters
26134 Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause
26135 And in this upshot purposes mistook
26136 Fall'n on th inventors heads All this can I
26137 Truly deliver
26138 Fort Let us haste to hear it
26139 And call the noblest to the audience
26140 For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
26141 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
26142 Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
26143 Hor Of that I shall have also cause to speak
26144 And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
26145 But let this same be presently perform'd
26146 Even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance
26147 On plots and errors happen
26148 Fort Let four captains
26149 Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
26150 For he was likely had he been put on
26151 To have prov'd most royally and for his passage
26152 The soldiers music and the rites of war
26153 Speak loudly for him
26154 Take up the bodies Such a sight as this
26155 Becomes the field but here shows much amiss
26156 Go bid the soldiers shoot
26157 Exeunt marching after the which a peal of ordnance
26158 are shot off

26204 SCENEEngland and Wales
26205 ACT I Scene I
26206 London The Palace
26207 Enter the King Lord John of Lancaster Earl of Westmoreland
26208 [Sir Walter Blunt] with others
26209 King So shaken as we are so wan with care
26210 Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
26211 And breathe shortwinded accents of new broils
26212 To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote
26213 No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
26214 Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood
26215 No more shall trenching war channel her fields
26216 Nor Bruise her flow'rets with the armed hoofs
26217 Of hostile paces Those opposed eyes
26218 Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
26219 All of one nature of one substance bred
26220 Did lately meet in the intestine shock
26221 And furious close of civil butchery
26222 Shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks
26223 March all one way and be no more oppos'd
26224 Against acquaintance kindred and allies
26225 The edge of war like an illsheathed knife
26226 No more shall cut his master Therefore friends
26227 As far as to the sepulchre of Christ
26228 Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
26229 We are impressed and engag'd to fight
26230 Forthwith a power of English shall we levy
26231 Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb
26232 To chase these pagans in those holy fields
26233 Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
26234 Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
26235 For our advantage on the bitter cross
26236 But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old
26237 And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go
26238 Therefore we meet not now Then let me hear
26239 Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland
26240 What yesternight our Council did decree
26241 In forwarding this dear expedience
26242 West My liege this haste was hot in question
26243 And many limits of the charge set down
26244 But yesternight when all athwart there came
26245 A post from Wales loaden with heavy news
26246 Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer
26247 Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
26248 Against the irregular and wild Glendower
26249 Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken
26250 A thousand of his people butchered
26251 Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
26252 Such beastly shameless transformation
26253 By those Welshwomen done as may not be
26254 Without much shame retold or spoken of
26255 King It seems then that the tidings of this broil
26256 Brake off our business for the Holy Land
26257 West This match'd with other did my gracious lord
26258 For more uneven and unwelcome news
26259 Came from the North and thus it did import
26260 On Holyrood Day the gallant Hotspur there
26261 Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald
26262 That evervaliant and approved Scot
26263 At Holmedon met
26264 Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
26265 As by discharge of their artillery
26266 And shape of likelihood the news was told
26267 For he that brought them in the very heat
26268 And pride of their contention did take horse
26269 Uncertain of the issue any way
26270 King Here is a dear a trueindustrious friend
26271 Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse
26272 Stain'd with the variation of each soil
26273 Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours
26274 And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
26275 The Earl of Douglas is discomfited
26276 Ten thousand bold Scots twoandtwenty knights
26277 Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
26278 On Holmedon's plains Of prisoners Hotspur took
26279 Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son
26280 To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol
26281 Of Murray Angus and Menteith
26282 And is not this an honourable spoil
26283 A gallant prize Ha cousin is it not
26284 West In faith
26285 It is a conquest for a prince to boast of
26286 King Yea there thou mak'st me sad and mak'st me sin
26287 In envy that my Lord Northumberland
26288 Should be the father to so blest a son
26289 A son who is the theme of honour's tongue
26290 Amongst a grove the very straightest plant
26291 Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride
26292 Whilst I by looking on the praise of him
26293 See riot and dishonour stain the brow
26294 Of my young Harry O that it could be prov'd
26295 That some nighttripping fairy had exchang'd
26296 In cradle clothes our children where they lay
26297 And call'd mine Percy his Plantagenet
26298 Then would I have his Harry and he mine
26299 But let him from my thoughts What think you coz
26300 Of this young Percy's pride The prisoners
26301 Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd
26302 To his own use he keeps and sends me word
26303 I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife
26304 West This is his uncle's teaching this Worcester
26305 Malevolent to you In all aspects
26306 Which makes him prune himself and bristle up
26307 The crest of youth against your dignity
26308 King But I have sent for him to answer this
26309 And for this cause awhile we must neglect
26310 Our holy purpose to Jerusalem
26311 Cousin on Wednesday next our council we
26312 Will hold at Windsor So inform the lords
26313 But come yourself with speed to us again
26314 For more is to be said and to be done
26315 Than out of anger can be uttered
26316 West I will my liege Exeunt
26317 Scene II
26318 London An apartment of the Prince's
26319 Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff
26320 Fal Now Hal what time of day is it lad
26321 Prince Thou art so fatwitted with drinking of old sack and
26322 unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after
26323 noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
26324 wouldest truly know What a devil hast thou to do with the time
26325 of the day Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons
26326 and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping
26327 houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in
26328 flamecoloured taffeta I see no reason why thou shouldst be so
26329 superfluous to demand the time of the day
26330 Fal Indeed you come near me now Hal for we that take purses go
26331 by the moon And the seven stars and not by Phoebus he that
26332 wand'ring knight so fair And I prithee sweet wag when thou art
26333 king as God save thy GraceMajesty I should say for grace thou
26334 wilt have none
26335 Prince What none
26336 Fal No by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue to
26337 an egg and butter
26338 Prince Well how then Come roundly roundly
26339 Fal Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that
26340 are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's
26341 beauty Let us be Diana's Foresters Gentlemen of the Shade
26342 Minions of the Moon and let men say we be men of good
26343 government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste
26344 mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
26345 Prince Thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of
26346 us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea being
26347 governed as the sea is by the moon As for proof now a purse
26348 of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most
26349 dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning got with swearing 'Lay by'
26350 and spent with crying 'Bring in now ill as low an ebb as the
26351 foot of the ladder and byandby in as high a flow as the ridge
26352 of the gallows
26353 Fal By the Lord thou say'st true lad and is not my hostess of
26354 the tavern a most sweet wench
26355 Prince As the honey of Hybla my old lad of the castle and is not
26356 a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
26357 Fal How now how now mad wag What in thy quips and thy
26358 quiddities What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin
26359 Prince Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern
26360 Fal Well thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft
26361 Prince Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part
26362 Fal No I'll give thee thy due thou hast paid all there
26363 Prince Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch and
26364 where it would not I have used my credit
26365 Fal Yea and so us'd it that were it not here apparent that thou
26366 art heir apparent But I prithee sweet wag shall there be
26367 gallows standing in England when thou art king and resolution
26368 thus fubb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the
26369 law Do not thou when thou art king hang a thief
26370 Prince No thou shalt
26371 Fal Shall I O rare By the Lord I'll be a brave judge
26372 Prince Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have the
26373 hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman
26374 Fal Well Hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour as
26375 well as waiting in the court I can tell you
26376 Prince For obtaining of suits
26377 Fal Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no lean
26378 wardrobe 'Sblood I am as melancholy as a gibcat or a lugg'd
26379 bear
26380 Prince Or an old lion or a lover's lute
26381 Fal Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe
26382 Prince What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moor
26383 Ditch
26384 Fal Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most
26385 comparative rascalliest sweet young prince But Hal I prithee
26386 trouble me no more with vanity I would to God thou and I knew
26387 where a commodity of good names were to be bought An old lord of
26388 the Council rated me the other day in the street about you sir
26389 but I mark'd him not and yet he talked very wisely but I
26390 regarded him not and yet he talk'd wisely and in the street
26391 too
26392 Prince Thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and
26393 no man regards it
26394 Fal O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to
26395 corrupt a saint Thou hast done much harm upon me Hal God
26396 forgive thee for it Before I knew thee Hal I knew nothing and
26397 now am I if a man should speak truly little better than one of
26398 the wicked I must give over this life and I will give it over
26399 By the Lord an I do not I am a villain I'll be damn'd for
26400 never a king's son in Christendom
26401 Prince Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack
26402 Fal Zounds where thou wilt lad I'll make one An I do not call
26403 me villain and baffle me
26404 Prince I see a good amendment of life in thee from praying to
26405 pursetaking
26406 Fal Why Hal 'tis my vocation Hal 'Tis no sin for a man to
26407 labour in his vocation
26408 Enter Poins
26409 Poins Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match O if men
26410 were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for
26411 him This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand'
26412 to a true man
26413 Prince Good morrow Ned
26414 Poins Good morrow sweet Hal What says Monsieur Remorse What
26415 says Sir John Sack and Sugar Jack how agrees the devil and thee
26416 about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a
26417 cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg
26418 Prince Sir John stands to his word the devil shall have his
26419 bargain for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs He will give
26420 the devil his due
26421 Poins Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the devil
26422 Prince Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil
26423 Poins But my lads my lads tomorrow morning by four o'clock
26424 early at Gadshill There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with
26425 rich offerings and traders riding to London with fat purses I
26426 have vizards for you all you have horses for yourselves
26427 Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester I have bespoke supper
26428 tomorrow night in Eastcheap We may do it as secure as sleep If
26429 you will go I will stuff your purses full of crowns if you will
26430 not tarry at home and be hang'd
26431 Fal Hear ye Yedward if I tarry at home and go not I'll hang you
26432 for going
26433 Poins You will chops
26434 Fal Hal wilt thou make one
26435 Prince Who I rob I a thief Not I by my faith
26436 Fal There's neither honesty manhood nor good fellowship in thee
26437 nor thou cam'st not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand
26438 for ten shillings
26439 Prince Well then once in my days I'll be a madcap
26440 Fal Why that's well said
26441 Prince Well come what will I'll tarry at home
26442 Fal By the Lord I'll be a traitor then when thou art king
26443 Prince I care not
26444 Poins Sir John I prithee leave the Prince and me alone I will
26445 lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go
26446 Fal Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears
26447 of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he hears
26448 may be believed that the true prince may for recreation sake
26449 prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want
26450 countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap
26451 Prince Farewell thou latter spring farewell Allhallown summer
26452 Exit Falstaff
26453 Poins Now my good sweet honey lord ride with us tomorrow I
26454 have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone Falstaff
26455 Bardolph Peto and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have
26456 already waylaid yourself and I will not be there and when they
26457 have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut this head off
26458 from my shoulders
26459 Prince How shall we part with them in setting forth
26460 Poins Why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
26461 a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and
26462 then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they
26463 shall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them
26464 Prince Yea but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses by
26465 our habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves
26466 Poins Tut our horses they shall not see I'll tie them in the
26467 wood our wizards we will change after we leave them and
26468 sirrah I have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our
26469 noted outward garments
26470 Prince Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us
26471 Poins Well for two of them I know them to be as truebred
26472 cowards as ever turn'd back and for the third if he fight
26473 longer than he sees reason I'll forswear arms The virtue of
26474 this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat
26475 rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least
26476 he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he
26477 endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest
26478 Prince Well I'll go with thee Provide us all things necessary
26479 and meet me tonight in Eastcheap There I'll sup Farewell
26480 Poins Farewell my lord Exit
26481 Prince I know you all and will awhile uphold
26482 The unyok'd humour of your idleness
26483 Yet herein will I imitate the sun
26484 Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
26485 To smother up his beauty from the world
26486 That when he please again to lie himself
26487 Being wanted he may be more wond'red at
26488 By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
26489 Of vapours that did seem to strangle him
26490 If all the year were playing holidays
26491 To sport would be as tedious as to work
26492 But when they seldom come they wish'dfor come
26493 And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
26494 So when this loose behaviour I throw off
26495 And pay the debt I never promised
26496 By how much better than my word I am
26497 By so much shall I falsify men's hopes
26498 And like bright metal on a sullen ground
26499 My reformation glitt'ring o'er my fault
26500 Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
26501 Than that which hath no foil to set it off
26502 I'll so offend to make offence a skill
26503 Redeeming time when men think least I will Exit
26504 Scene III
26505 London The Palace
26506 Enter the King Northumberland Worcester Hotspur Sir Walter Blunt
26507 with others
26508 King My blood hath been too cold and temperate
26509 Unapt to stir at these indignities
26510 And you have found me for accordingly
26511 You tread upon my patience but be sure
26512 I will from henceforth rather be myself
26513 Mighty and to be fear'd than my condition
26514 Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
26515 And therefore lost that title of respect
26516 Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud
26517 Wor Our house my sovereign liege little deserves
26518 The scourge of greatness to be us'd on it
26519 And that same greatness too which our own hands
26520 Have holp to make so portly
26521 North My lord
26522 King Worcester get thee gone for I do see
26523 Danger and disobedience in thine eye
26524 O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
26525 And majesty might never yet endure
26526 The moody frontier of a servant brow
26527 Tou have good leave to leave us When we need
26528 'Your use and counsel we shall send for you
26529 Exit Worcester
26530 You were about to speak
26531 North Yea my good lord
26532 Those prisoners in your Highness name demanded
26533 Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took
26534 Were as he says not with such strength denied
26535 As is delivered to your Majesty
26536 Either envy therefore or misprision
26537 Is guilty of this fault and not my son
26538 Hot My liege I did deny no prisoners
26539 But I remember when the fight was done
26540 When I was dry with rage and extreme toll
26541 Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
26542 Came there a certain lord neat and trimly dress'd
26543 Fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reap'd
26544 Show'd like a stubble land at harvest home
26545 He was perfumed like a milliner
26546 And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
26547 A pouncet box which ever and anon
26548 He gave his nose and took't away again
26549 Who therewith angry when it next came there
26550 Took it in snuff and still he smil'd and talk'd
26551 And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
26552 He call'd them untaught knaves unmannerly
26553 To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
26554 Betwixt the wind and his nobility
26555 With many holiday and lady terms
26556 He questioned me amongst the rest demanded
26557 My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf
26558 I then all smarting with my wounds being cold
26559 To be so pest'red with a popingay
26560 Out of my grief and my impatience
26561 Answer'd neglectingly I know not what
26562 He should or he should not for he made me mad
26563 To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
26564 And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
26565 Of guns and drums and wounds God save the mark
26566 And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
26567 Was parmacity for an inward bruise
26568 And that it was great pity so it was
26569 This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd
26570 Out of the bowels of the harmless earth
26571 Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
26572 So cowardly and but for these vile 'guns
26573 He would himself have been a soldier
26574 This bald unjointed chat of his my lord
26575 I answered indirectly as I said
26576 And I beseech you let not his report
26577 Come current for an accusation
26578 Betwixt my love and your high majesty
26579 Blunt The circumstance considered good my lord
26580 Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
26581 To such a person and in such a place
26582 At such a time with all the rest retold
26583 May reasonably die and never rise
26584 To do him wrong or any way impeach
26585 What then he said so he unsay it now
26586 King Why yet he doth deny his prisoners
26587 But with proviso and exception
26588 That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
26589 His brotherinlaw the foolish Mortimer
26590 Who on my soul hath wilfully betray'd
26591 The lives of those that he did lead to fight
26592 Against that great magician damn'd Glendower
26593 Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March
26594 Hath lately married Shall our coffers then
26595 Be emptied to redeem a traitor home
26596 Shall we buy treason and indent with fears
26597 When they have lost and forfeited themselves
26598 No on the barren mountains let him starve
26599 For I shall never hold that man my friend
26600 Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
26601 To ransom home revolted Mortimer
26602 Hot Revolted Mortimer
26603 He never did fall off my sovereign liege
26604 But by the chance of war To prove that true
26605 Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
26606 Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
26607 When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank
26608 In single opposition hand to hand
26609 He did confound the best part of an hour
26610 In changing hardiment with great Glendower
26611 Three times they breath'd and three times did they drink
26612 Upon agreement of swift Severn's flood
26613 Who then affrighted with their bloody looks
26614 Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
26615 And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
26616 Bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants
26617 Never did base and rotten policy
26618 Colour her working with such deadly wounds
26619 Nor never could the noble Mortimer
26620 Receive so many and all willingly
26621 Then let not him be slandered with revolt
26622 King Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him
26623 He never did encounter with Glendower
26624 I tell thee
26625 He durst as well have met the devil alone
26626 As Owen Glendower for an enemy
26627 Art thou not asham'd But sirrah henceforth
26628 Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer
26629 Send me your prisoners with the speediest means
26630 Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
26631 As will displease you My Lord Northumberland
26632 We license your departure with your son
26633 Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
26634 Exeunt King [Blunt and Train]
26635 Hot An if the devil come and roar for them
26636 I will not send them I will after straight
26637 And tell him so for I will else my heart
26638 Albeit I make a hazard of my head
26639 North What drunk with choler Stay and pause awhile
26640 Here comes your uncle
26641 Enter Worcester
26642 Hot Speak of Mortimer
26643 Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul
26644 Want mercy if I do not join with him
26645 Yea on his part I'll empty all these veins
26646 And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
26647 But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
26648 As high in the air as this unthankful king
26649 As this ingrate and cank'red Bolingbroke
26650 North Brother the King hath made your nephew mad
26651 Wor Who struck this heat up after I was gone
26652 Hot He will forsooth have all my prisoners
26653 And when I urg'd the ransom once again
26654 Of my wive's brother then his cheek look'd pale
26655 And on my face he turn'd an eye of death
26656 Trembling even at the name of Mortimer
26657 Wor I cannot blame him Was not he proclaim'd
26658 By Richard that dead is the next of blood
26659 North He was I heard the proclamation
26660 And then it was when the unhappy King
26661 Whose wrongs in us God pardon did set forth
26662 Upon his Irish expedition
26663 From whence he intercepted did return
26664 To be depos'd and shortly murdered
26665 Wor And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
26666 Live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of
26667 Hot But soft I pray you Did King Richard then
26668 Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
26669 Heir to the crown
26670 North He did myself did hear it
26671 Hot Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king
26672 That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve
26673 But shall it be that you that set the crown
26674 Upon the head of this forgetful man
26675 And for his sake wear the detested blot
26676 Of murtherous subornation shall it be
26677 That you a world of curses undergo
26678 Being the agents or base second means
26679 The cords the ladder or the hangman rather
26680 O pardon me that I descend so low
26681 To show the line and the predicament
26682 Wherein you range under this subtile king
26683 Shall it for shame be spoken in these days
26684 Or fill up chronicles in time to come
26685 That men of your nobility and power
26686 Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
26687 As both of you God pardon it have done
26688 To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose
26689 And plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke
26690 And shall it in more shame be further spoken
26691 That you are fool'd discarded and shook off
26692 By him for whom these shames ye underwent
26693 No yet time serves wherein you may redeem
26694 Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
26695 Into the good thoughts of the world again
26696 Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
26697 Of this proud king who studies day and night
26698 To answer all the debt he owes to you
26699 Even with the bloody payment of your deaths
26700 Therefore I say
26701 Wor Peace cousin say no more
26702 And now I will unclasp a secret book
26703 And to your quickconceiving discontents
26704 I'll read you matter deep and dangerous
26705 As full of peril and adventurous spirit
26706 As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud
26707 On the unsteadfast footing of a spear
26708 Hot If he fall in good night or sink or swim
26709 Send danger from the east unto the west
26710 So honour cross it from the north to south
26711 And let them grapple O the blood more stirs
26712 To rouse a lion than to start a hare
26713 North Imagination of some great exploit
26714 Drives him beyond the bounds of patience
26715 Hot By heaven methinks it were an easy leap
26716 To pluck bright honour from the palefac'd moon
26717 Or dive into the bottom of the deep
26718 Where fadom line could never touch the ground
26719 And pluck up drowned honour by the locks
26720 So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
26721 Without corrival all her dignities
26722 But out upon this halffac'd fellowship
26723 Wor He apprehends a world of figures here
26724 But not the form of what he should attend
26725 Good cousin give me audience for a while
26726 Hot I cry you mercy
26727 Wor Those same noble Scots
26728 That are your prisoners
26729 Hot I'll keep them all
26730 By God he shall not have a Scot of them
26731 No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not
26732 I'll keep them by this hand
26733 Wor You start away
26734 And lend no ear unto my purposes
26735 Those prisoners you shall keep
26736 Hot Nay I will That is flat
26737 He said he would not ransom Mortimer
26738 Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer
26739 But I will find him when he lies asleep
26740 And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer'
26741 Nay
26742 I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
26743 Nothing but 'Mortimer and give it him
26744 To keep his anger still in motion
26745 Wor Hear you cousin a word
26746 Hot All studies here I solemnly defy
26747 Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
26748 And that same swordandbuckler Prince of Wales
26749 But that I think his father loves him not
26750 And would be glad he met with some mischance
26751 I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale
26752 Wor Farewell kinsman I will talk to you
26753 When you are better temper'd to attend
26754 North Why what a waspstung and impatient fool
26755 Art thou to break into this woman's mood
26756 Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
26757 Hot Why look you I am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods
26758 Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
26759 Of this vile politician Bolingbroke
26760 In Richard's time what do you call the place
26761 A plague upon it it is in GIoucestershire
26762 'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept
26763 His uncle York where I first bow'd my knee
26764 Unto this king of smiles this Bolingbroke
26765 'S blood
26766 When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh
26767 North At Berkeley Castle
26768 Hot You say true
26769 Why what a candy deal of courtesy
26770 This fawning greyhound then did proffer me
26771 Look 'when his infant fortune came to age'
26772 And 'gentle Harry Percy and 'kind cousin'
26773 O the devil take such cozeners God forgive me
26774 Good uncle tell your tale for I have done
26775 Wor Nay if you have not to it again
26776 We will stay your leisure
26777 Hot I have done i faith

26779 Deliver them up without their ransom straight
26780 And make the Douglas son your only mean
26781 For powers In Scotland which for divers reasons
26782 Which I shall send you written be assur'd
26783 Will easily be granted [To Northumberland] You my lord
26784 Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd
26785 Shall secretly into the bosom creep
26786 Of that same noble prelate wellbelov'd
26787 The Archbishop
26788 Hot Of York is it not
26789 Wor True who bears hard
26790 His brother's death at Bristow the Lord Scroop
26791 I speak not this in estimation
26792 As what I think might be but what I know
26793 Is ruminated plotted and set down
26794 And only stays but to behold the face
26795 Of that occasion that shall bring it on
26796 Hot I smell it Upon my life it will do well
26797 North Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip
26798 Hot Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
26799 And then the power of Scotland and of York

26802 Hot In faith it is exceedingly well aim'd
26803 Wor And 'tis no little reason bids us speed
26804 To save our heads by raising of a head
26805 For bear ourselves as even as we can
26806 The King will always think him in our debt
26807 And think we think ourselves unsatisfied
26808 Till he hath found a time to pay us home
26809 And see already how he doth begin
26810 To make us strangers to his looks of love
26811 Hot He does he does We'll be reveng'd on him
26812 Wor Cousin farewell No further go in this
26813 Than I by letters shall direct your course
26814 When time is ripe which will be suddenly
26815 I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer
26816 Where you and Douglas and our pow'rs at once
26817 As I will fashion it shall happily meet
26818 To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
26819 Which now we hold at much uncertainty
26820 North Farewell good brother We shall thrive I trust
26821 Hot Uncle adieu O let the hours be short
26822 Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport Exeunt

27425 truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in
27426 fight and persuaded us to do the like
27427 Bard Yea and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them
27428 bleed and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it

27449 man up like a bladder There's villanous news abroad Here was
27450 Sir John Bracy from your father You must to the court in the
27451 morning That same mad fellow of the North Percy and he of

27454 hook what a plague call you him

27476 good trading that way But tell me Hal art not thou horrible
27477 afeard Thou being heir apparent could the world pick thee out
27478 three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas that spirit
27479 Percy and that devil Glendower Art thou not horribly afraid
27480 Doth not thy blood thrill at it
27481 Prince Not a whit i faith I lack some of thy instinct

27487 sceptre and this cushion my crown
27488 Prince Thy state is taken for a join'dstool thy golden sceptre

27492 thou be moved Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red
27493 that it may be thought I have wept for I must speak in passion
27494 and I will do it in King Cambyses vein
27495 Prince Well here is my leg
27496 Fal And here is my speech Stand aside nobility
27497 Host O Jesu this is excellent sport i faith
27498 Fal Weep not sweet queen for trickling tears are vain
27499 Host O the Father how he holds his countenance
27500 Fal For God's sake lords convey my tristful queen
27501 For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes
27502 Host O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as
27503 ever I see
27504 Fal Peace good pintpot Peace good ticklebrain Harry I do
27505 not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou
27506 art accompanied For though the camomile the more it is trodden
27507 on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
27508 sooner it wears That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's
27509 word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of
27510 thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth
27511 warrant me If then thou be son to me here lies the point why
27512 being son to me art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of
27513 heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries A question not to be
27514 ask'd Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses A
27515 question to be ask'd There is a thing Harry which thou hast
27516 often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name
27517 of pitch This pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile
27518 so doth the company thou keepest For Harry now I do not speak
27519 to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion
27520 not in words only but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous
27521 man whom I have often noted in thy company but I know not his
27522 name
27523 Prince What manner of man an it like your Majesty
27524 Fal A goodly portly man i faith and a corpulent of a cheerful
27525 look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as I think
27526 his age some fifty or by'r Lady inclining to threescore and
27527 now I remember me his name is Falstaff If that man should be
27528 lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry I see virtue in his
27529 looks If then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit
27530 by the tree then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in
27531 that Falstaff Him keep with the rest banish And tell me now
27532 thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month
27533 Prince Dost thou speak like a king Do thou stand for me and I'll
27534 play my father
27535 Fal Depose me If thou dost it half so gravely so majestically
27536 both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a
27537 rabbitsucker or a poulter's hare
27538 Prince Well here I am set
27539 Fal And here I stand Judge my masters
27540 Prince Now Harry whence come you
27541 Fal My noble lord from Eastcheap
27542 Prince The complaints I hear of thee are grievous
27543 Fal 'Sblood my lord they are false Nay I'll tickle ye for a
27544 young prince i faith
27545 Prince Swearest thou ungracious boy Henceforth ne'er look on me
27546 Thou art violently carried away from grace There is a devil
27547 haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man a tun of man is
27548 thy companion Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours
27549 that bolting hutch of beastliness that swoll'n parcel of
27550 dropsies that huge bombard of sack that stuff'd cloakbag of
27551 guts that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly
27552 that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that
27553 vanity in years Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink
27554 it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it
27555 wherein cunning but in craft wherein crafty but in villany
27556 wherein villanous but in all things wherein worthy but in
27557 nothing
27558 Fal I would your Grace would take me with you Whom means your
27559 Grace
27560 Prince That villanous abominable misleader of youth Falstaff
27561 that old whitebearded Satan
27562 Fal My lord the man I know
27563 Prince I know thou dost
27564 Fal But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say
27565 more than I know That he is old the more the pity his white
27566 hairs do witness it but that he is saving your reverence a
27567 whoremaster that I utterly deny If sack and sugar be a fault
27568 God help the wicked If to be old and merry be a sin then many
27569 an old host that I know is damn'd If to be fat be to be hated
27570 then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved No my good lord
27571 Banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Poins but for sweet Jack
27572 Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff valiant Jack

27586 What's the matter
27587 Host The sheriff and all the watch are at the door They are come
27588 to search the house Shall I let them in
27589 Fal Dost thou hear Hal Never call a true piece of gold a
27590 counterfeit Thou art essentially mad without seeming so
27591 Prince And thou a natural coward without instinct
27592 Fal I deny your major If you will deny the sheriff so if not
27593 let him enter If I become not a cart as well as another man a
27594 plague on my bringing up I hope I shall as soon be strangled
27595 with a halter as another

27659 Enter Hotspur Worcester Lord Mortimer Owen Glendower
27660 Mort These promises are fair the parties sure
27661 And our induction full of prosperous hope
27662 Hot Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower
27663 Will you sit down
27664 And uncle Worcester A plague upon it
27665 I have forgot the map
27666 Glend No here it is
27667 Sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur
27668 For by that name as oft as Lancaster
27669 Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
27670 A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
27671 Hot And you in hell as oft as he hears
27672 Owen Glendower spoke of
27673 Glend I cannot blame him At my nativity
27674 The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
27675 Of burning cressets and at my birth
27676 The frame and huge foundation of the earth
27677 Shak'd like a coward
27678 Hot Why so it would have done at the same season if your
27679 mother's cat had but kitten'd though yourself had never been
27680 born
27681 Glend I say the earth did shake when I was born
27682 Hot And I say the earth was not of my mind
27683 If you suppose as fearing you it shook
27684 Glend The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
27685 Hot O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
27686 And not in fear of your nativity
27687 Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
27688 In strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
27689 Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
27690 By the imprisoning of unruly wind
27691 Within her womb which for enlargement striving
27692 Shakes the old beldame earth and topples down
27693 Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth
27694 Our grandam earth having this distemp'rature
27695 In passion shook
27696 Glend Cousin of many men
27697 I do not bear these crossings Give me leave
27698 To tell you once again that at my birth
27699 The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
27700 The goats ran from the mountains and the herds
27701 Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
27702 These signs have mark'd me extraordinary
27703 And all the courses of my life do show
27704 I am not in the roll of common men
27705 Where is he living clipp'd in with the sea
27706 That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales
27707 Which calls me pupil or hath read to me
27708 And bring him out that is but woman's son
27709 Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
27710 And hold me pace in deep experiments
27711 Hot I think there's no man speaks better Welsh I'll to dinner
27712 Mort Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad
27713 Glend I can call spirits from the vasty deep
27714 Hot Why so can I or so can any man
27715 But will they come when you do call for them
27716 Glend Why I can teach you cousin to command the devil
27717 Hot And I can teach thee coz to shame the devil
27718 By telling truth Tell truth and shame the devil
27719 If thou have power to raise him bring him hither
27720 And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence
27721 O while you live tell truth and shame the devil
27722 Mort Come come no more of this unprofitable chat
27723 Glend Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
27724 Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye
27725 And sandybottom'd Severn have I sent him
27726 Bootless home and weatherbeaten back
27727 Hot Home without boots and in foul weather too
27728 How scapes he agues in the devil's name
27729 Glend Come here's the map Shall we divide our right
27730 According to our threefold order ta'en
27731 Mort The Archdeacon hath divided it
27732 Into three limits very equally
27733 England from Trent and Severn hitherto
27734 By south and east is to my part assign'd
27735 All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore
27736 And all the fertile land within that bound
27737 To Owen Glendower and dear coz to you
27738 The remnant northward lying off from Trent
27739 And our indentures tripartite are drawn
27740 Which being sealed interchangeably
27741 A business that this night may execute
27742 Tomorrow cousin Percy you and I
27743 And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
27744 To meet your father and the Scottish bower
27745 As is appointed us at Shrewsbury
27746 My father Glendower is not ready yet
27747 Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days
27748 [To Glend] Within that space you may have drawn together
27749 Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
27750 Glend A shorter time shall send me to you lords
27751 And in my conduct shall your ladies come
27752 From whom you now must steal and take no leave
27753 For there will be a world of water shed
27754 Upon the parting of your wives and you
27755 Hot Methinks my moiety north from Burton here
27756 In quantity equals not one of yours
27757 See how this river comes me cranking in
27758 And cuts me from the best of all my land
27759 A huge halfmoon a monstrous cantle out
27760 I'll have the current ill this place damm'd up
27761 And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run
27762 In a new channel fair and evenly
27763 It shall not wind with such a deep indent
27764 To rob me of so rich a bottom here
27765 Glend Not wind It shall it must You see it doth
27766 Mort Yea but
27767 Mark how he bears his course and runs me up
27768 With like advantage on the other side
27769 Gelding the opposed continent as much
27770 As on the other side it takes from you
27771 Wor Yea but a little charge will trench him here
27772 And on this north side win this cape of land
27773 And then he runs straight and even
27774 Hot I'll have it so A little charge will do it
27775 Glend I will not have it alt'red
27776 Hot Will not you
27777 Glend No nor you shall not
27778 Hot Who shall say me nay
27779 Glend No that will I
27780 Hot Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh
27781 Glend I can speak English lord as well as you
27782 For I was train'd up in the English court
27783 Where being but young I framed to the harp
27784 Many an English ditty lovely well
27785 And gave the tongue a helpful ornament
27786 A virtue that was never seen in you
27787 Hot Marry
27788 And I am glad of it with all my heart
27789 I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
27790 Than one of these same metre balletmongers
27791 I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
27792 Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
27793 And that would set my teeth nothing on edge
27794 Nothing so much as mincing poetry
27795 'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag
27796 Glend Come you shall have Trent turn'd
27797 Hot I do not care I'll give thrice so much land
27798 To any welldeserving friend
27799 But in the way of bargain mark ye me
27800 I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair
27801 Are the indentures drawn Shall we be gone
27802 Glend The moon shines fair you may away by night
27803 I'll haste the writer and withal
27804 Break with your wives of your departure hence
27805 I am afraid my daughter will run mad
27806 So much she doteth on her Mortimer Exit
27807 Mort Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father
27808 Hot I cannot choose Sometimes he angers me
27809 With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
27810 Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies
27811 And of a dragon and a finless fish
27812 A clipwing'd griffin and a moulten raven
27813 A couching lion and a ramping cat
27814 And such a deal of skimbleskamble stuff
27815 As puts me from my faith I tell you what
27816 He held me last night at least nine hours
27817 In reckoning up the several devils names
27818 That were his lackeys I cried 'hum and 'Well go to'
27819 But mark'd him not a word O he is as tedious
27820 As a tired horse a railing wife
27821 Worse than a smoky house I had rather live
27822 With cheese and garlic in a windmill far
27823 Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
27824 In any summer house in Christendom
27825 Mort In faith he is a worthy gentleman
27826 Exceedingly well read and profited
27827 In strange concealments valiant as a lion
27828 And wondrous affable and as bountiful
27829 As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin
27830 He holds your temper in a high respect
27831 And curbs himself even of his natural scope
27832 When you come 'cross his humour Faith he does
27833 I warrant you that man is not alive
27834 Might so have tempted him as you have done
27835 Without the taste of danger and reproof
27836 But do not use it oft let me entreat you
27837 Wor In faith my lord you are too wilfulblame
27838 And since your coming hither have done enough
27839 To put him quite besides his patience
27840 You must needs learn lord to amend this fault
27841 Though sometimes it show greatness courage blood
27842 And that's the dearest grace it renders you
27843 Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
27844 Defect of manners want of government
27845 Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
27846 The least of which haunting a nobleman
27847 Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
27848 Upon the beauty of all parts besides
27849 Beguiling them of commendation
27850 Hot Well I am school'd Good manners be your speed
27851 Here come our wives and let us take our leave
27852 Enter Glendower with the Ladies
27853 Mort This is the deadly spite that angers me
27854 My wife can speak no English I no Welsh
27855 Glend My daughter weeps she will not part with you
27856 She'll be a soldier too she'll to the wars
27857 Mort Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy
27858 Shall follow in your conduct speedily
27859 Glendower speaks to her in Welsh and she answers
27860 him in the same
27861 Glend She is desperate here A peevish selfwill'd harlotry
27862 One that no persuasion can do good upon
27863 The Lady speaks in Welsh
27864 Mort I understand thy looks That pretty Welsh
27865 Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
27866 I am too perfect in and but for shame
27867 In such a Barley should I answer thee
27868 The Lady again in Welsh
27869 I understand thy kisses and thou mine
27870 And that's a feeling disputation
27871 But I will never be a truant love
27872 Till I have learnt thy language for thy tongue
27873 Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd
27874 Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r
27875 With ravishing division to her lute
27876 Glend Nay if you melt then will she run mad
27877 The Lady speaks again in Welsh
27878 Mort O I am ignorance itself in this
27879 Glend She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
27880 And rest your gentle head upon her lap
27881 And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
27882 And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
27883 Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
27884 Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
27885 As is the difference betwixt day and night
27886 The hour before the heavenlyharness'd team
27887 Begins his golden progress in the East
27888 Mort With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing
27889 By that time will our book I think be drawn
27890 Glend Do so
27891 And those musicians that shall play to you
27892 Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
27893 And straight they shall be here Sit and attend
27894 Hot Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down Come quick
27895 quick that I may lay my head in thy lap
27896 Lady P Go ye giddy goose
27897 The music plays
27898 Hot Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh
27899 And 'tis no marvel be is so humorous
27900 By'r Lady he is a good musician
27901 Lady P Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
27902 altogether govern'd by humours Lie still ye thief and hear the
27903 lady sing in Welsh
27904 Hot I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish
27905 Lady P Wouldst thou have thy head broken
27906 Hot No
27907 Lady P Then be still
27908 Hot Neither 'Tis a woman's fault
27909 Lady P Now God help thee
27910 Hot To the Welsh lady's bed
27911 Lady P What's that
27912 Hot Peace she sings
27913 Here the Lady sings a Welsh song
27914 Come Kate I'll have your song too
27915 Lady P Not mine in good sooth
27916 Hot Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a
27917 comfitmaker's wife 'Not you in good sooth and 'as true as I
27918 live and 'as God shall mend me and 'as sure as day'
27919 And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
27920 As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury
27921 Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art
27922 A good mouthfilling oath and leave 'in sooth'
27923 And such protest of pepper gingerbread
27924 To velvet guards and Sunday citizens Come sing
27925 Lady P I will not sing
27926 Hot 'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreastteacher An
27927 the indentures be drawn I'll away within these two hours and so
27928 come in when ye will Exit
27929 Glend Come come Lord Mortimer You are as slow
27930 As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go
27931 By this our book is drawn we'll but seal
27932 And then to horse immediately
27933 Mort With all my heart
27934 Exeunt
27935 Scene II
27936 London The Palace
27937 Enter the King Prince of Wales and others
27938 King Lords give us leave The Prince of Wales and I
27939 Must have some private conference but be near at hand
27940 For we shall presently have need of you
27941 Exeunt Lords
27942 I know not whether God will have it so
27943 For some displeasing service I have done
27944 That in his secret doom out of my blood
27945 He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me
27946 But thou dost in thy passages of life
27947 Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
27948 For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
27949 To punish my mistreadings Tell me else
27950 Could such inordinate and low desires
27951 Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
27952 Such barren pleasures rude society
27953 As thou art match'd withal and grafted to
27954 Accompany the greatness of thy blood
27955 And hold their level with thy princely heart
27956 Prince So please your Majesty I would I could
27957 Quit all offences with as clear excuse
27958 As well as I am doubtless I can purge
27959 Myself of many I am charged withal
27960 Yet such extenuation let me beg
27961 As in reproof of many tales devis'd
27962 Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear
27963 By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
27964 I may for some things true wherein my youth
27965 Hath faulty wand'red and irregular
27966 And pardon on lily true submission
27967 King God pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry
27968 At thy affections which do hold a wing
27969 Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
27970 Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost
27971 Which by thy younger brother is supplied
27972 And art almost an alien to the hearts
27973 Of all the court and princes of my blood
27974 The hope and expectation of thy time
27975 Is ruin'd and the soul of every man
27976 Prophetically do forethink thy fall
27977 Had I so lavish of my presence been
27978 So commonhackney'd in the eyes of men
27979 So stale and cheap to vulgar company
27980 Opinion that did help me to the crown
27981 Had still kept loyal to possession
27982 And left me in reputeless banishment
27983 A fellow of no mark nor likelihood
27984 By being seldom seen I could not stir
27985 But like a comet I Was wond'red at
27986 That men would tell their children 'This is he'
27987 Others would say 'Where Which is Bolingbroke'
27988 And then I stole all courtesy from heaven
27989 And dress'd myself in such humility
27990 That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts
27991 Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
27992 Even in the presence of the crowned King
27993 Thus did I keep my person fresh and new
27994 My presence like a robe pontifical
27995 Ne'er seen but wond'red at and so my state
27996 Seldom but sumptuous show'd like a feast
27997 And won by rareness such solemnity
27998 The skipping King he ambled up and down
27999 With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
28000 Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
28001 Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools
28002 Had his great name profaned with their scorns
28003 And gave his countenance against his name
28004 To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
28005 Of every beardless vain comparative
28006 Grew a companion to the common streets
28007 Enfeoff'd himself to popularity
28008 That being dally swallowed by men's eyes
28009 They surfeited with honey and began
28010 To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
28011 More than a little is by much too much
28012 So when he had occasion to be seen
28013 He was but as the cuckoo is in June
28014 Heard not regarded seen but with such eyes
28015 As sick and blunted with community
28016 Afford no extraordinary gaze
28017 Such as is bent on unlike majesty
28018 When it shines seldom in admiring eyes
28019 But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down
28020 Slept in his face and rend'red such aspect
28021 As cloudy men use to their adversaries
28022 Being with his presence glutted gorg'd and full
28023 And in that very line Harry standest thou
28024 For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
28025 With vile participation Not an eye
28026 But is aweary of thy common sight
28027 Save mine which hath desir'd to see thee more
28028 Which now doth that I would not have it do
28029 Make blind itself with foolish tenderness
28030 Prince I shall hereafter my thricegracious lord
28031 Be more myself
28032 King For all the world
28033 As thou art to this hour was Richard then
28034 When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh
28035 And even as I was then is Percy now
28036 Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
28037 He hath more worthy interest to the state
28038 Than thou the shadow of succession
28039 For of no right nor colour like to right
28040 He doth fill fields with harness in the realm
28041 Turns head against the lion's armed jaws
28042 And Being no more in debt to years than thou
28043 Leads ancient lords and reverend Bishops on
28044 To bloody battles and to bruising arms
28045 What neverdying honour hath he got
28046 Against renowmed Douglas whose high deeds
28047 Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
28048 Holds from all soldiers chief majority
28049 And military title capital
28050 Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
28051 Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes
28052 This infant warrior in his enterprises
28053 Discomfited great Douglas ta'en him once
28054 Enlarged him and made a friend of him
28055 To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
28056 And shake the peace and safety of our throne
28057 And what say you to this Percy Northumberland
28058 The Archbishop's Grace of York Douglas Mortimer
28059 Capitulate against us and are up
28060 But wherefore do I tell these news to thee
28061 Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes
28062 Which art my nearest and dearest enemy'
28063 Thou that art like enough through vassal fear
28064 Base inclination and the start of spleen
28065 To fight against me under Percy's pay
28066 To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
28067 To show how much thou art degenerate
28068 Prince Do not think so You shall not find it so
28069 And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
28070 Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me
28071 I will redeem all this on Percy's head
28072 And in the closing of some glorious day
28073 Be bold to tell you that I am your son
28074 When I will wear a garment all of blood
28075 And stain my favours in a bloody mask
28076 Which wash'd away shall scour my shame with it
28077 And that shall be the day whene'er it lights
28078 That this same child of honour and renown
28079 This gallant Hotspur this allpraised knight
28080 And your unthought of Harry chance to meet
28081 For every honour sitting on his helm
28082 Would they were multitudes and on my head
28083 My shames redoubled For the time will come
28084 That I shall make this Northern youth exchange
28085 His glorious deeds for my indignities
28086 Percy is but my factor good my lord
28087 To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
28088 And I will call hall to so strict account
28089 That he shall render every glory up
28090 Yea even the slightest worship of his time
28091 Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart
28092 This in the name of God I promise here
28093 The which if he be pleas'd I shall perform
28094 I do beseech your Majesty may salve
28095 The longgrown wounds of my intemperance
28096 If not the end of life cancels all bands
28097 And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
28098 Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
28099 King A hundred thousand rebels die in this
28100 Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein

28146 Fal No I'll be sworn I make as good use of it as many a man doth
28147 of a death'shead or a memento mori I never see thy face but I
28148 think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple for there he
28149 is in his robes burning burning if thou wert any way given to
28150 virtue I would swear by thy face my oath should be 'By this
28151 fire that's God's angel But thou art altogether given over
28152 and wert indeed but for the light in thy face the son of utter
28153 darkness When thou ran'st up Gadshill in the night to catch my
28154 horse if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a
28155 ball of wildfire there's no purchase in money O thou art a
28156 perpetual triumph an everlasting bonfirelight Thou hast saved
28157 me a thousand marks in links and torches walking with thee in
28158 the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast
28159 drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest
28160 chandler's in Europe I have maintained that salamander of yours
28161 with fire any time this twoandthirty years God reward me for
28162 it

28315 ACT IV Scene I
28316 The rebel camp near Shrewsbury
28317 Enter Harry Hotspur Worcester and Douglas
28318 Hot Well said my noble Scot If speaking truth
28319 In this fine age were not thought flattery
28320 Such attribution should the Douglas have
28321 As not a soldier of this season's stamp
28322 Should go so general current through the world
28323 By God I cannot flatter I defy
28324 The tongues of soothers but a braver place
28325 In my heart's love hath no man than yourself
28326 Nay task me to my word approve me lord
28327 Doug Thou art the king of honour
28328 No man so potent breathes upon the ground
28329 But I will beard him
28330 Enter one with letters
28331 Hot Do so and 'tis well
28332 What letters hast thou there I can but thank you
28333 Messenger These letters come from your father
28334 Hot Letters from him Why comes he not himself
28335 Mess He cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
28336 Hot Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
28337 In such a justling time Who leads his power
28338 Under whose government come they along
28339 Mess His letters bears his mind not I my lord
28340 Wor I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
28341 Mess He did my lord four days ere I set forth
28342 And at the time of my departure thence
28343 He was much fear'd by his physicians
28344 Wor I would the state of time had first been whole
28345 Ere he by sickness had been visited
28346 His health was never better worth than now
28347 Hot Sick now droop now This sickness doth infect
28348 The very lifeblood of our enterprise
28349 'Tis catching hither even to our camp
28350 He writes me here that inward sickness
28351 And that his friends by deputation could not
28352 So soon be drawn no did he think it meet
28353 To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
28354 On any soul remov'd but on his own
28355 Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
28356 That with our small conjunction we should on
28357 To see how fortune is dispos'd to us
28358 For as he writes there is no quailing now
28359 Because the King is certainly possess'd
28360 Of all our purposes What say you to it
28361 Wor Your father's sickness is a maim to us
28362 Hot A perilous gash a very limb lopp'd off
28363 And yet in faith it is not His present want
28364 Seems more than we shall find it Were it good
28365 To set the exact wealth of all our states
28366 All at one cast to set so rich a man
28367 On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
28368 It were not good for therein should we read
28369 The very bottom and the soul of hope
28370 The very list the very utmost bound
28371 Of all our fortunes
28372 Doug Faith and so we should
28373 Where now remains a sweet reversion
28374 We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
28375 Is to come in
28376 A comfort of retirement lives in this
28377 Hot A rendezvous a home to fly unto
28378 If that the devil and mischance look big
28379 Upon the maidenhead of our affairs
28380 Wor But yet I would your father had been here
28381 The quality and hair of our attempt
28382 Brooks no division It will be thought
28383 By some that know not why he is away
28384 That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
28385 Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence
28386 And think how such an apprehension
28387 May turn the tide of fearful faction
28388 And breed a kind of question in our cause
28389 For well you know we of the off'ring side
28390 Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
28391 And stop all sightholes every loop from whence
28392 The eye of reason may pry in upon us
28393 This absence of your father's draws a curtain
28394 That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
28395 Before not dreamt of
28396 Hot You strain too far
28397 I rather of his absence make this use
28398 It lends a lustre and more great opinion
28399 A larger dare to our great enterprise
28400 Than if the Earl were here for men must think
28401 If we without his help can make a head
28402 To push against a kingdom with his help
28403 We shall o'erturn it topsyturvy down
28404 Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
28405 Doug As heart can think There is not such a word
28406 Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear
28407 Enter Sir Richard Vernon
28408 Hot My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul
28409 Ver Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord
28410 The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong
28411 Is marching hitherwards with him Prince John
28412 Hot No harm What more
28413 Ver And further I have learn'd
28414 The King himself in person is set forth
28415 Or hitherwards intended speedily
28416 With strong and mighty preparation
28417 Hot He shall be welcome too Where is his son
28418 The nimblefooted madcap Prince of Wales
28419 And his comrades that daff'd the world aside
28420 And bid it pass
28421 Ver All furnish'd all in arms
28422 All plum'd like estridges that with the wind
28423 Bated like eagles having lately bath'd
28424 Glittering in golden coats like images
28425 As full of spirit as the month of May
28426 And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
28427 Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
28428 I saw young Harry with his beaver on
28429 His cushes on his thighs gallantly arm'd
28430 Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury
28431 And vaulted with such ease into his seat
28432 As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds
28433 To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
28434 And witch the world with noble horsemanship
28435 Hot No more no more Worse than the sun in March
28436 This praise doth nourish agues Let them come
28437 They come like sacrifices in their trim
28438 And to the fireey'd maid of smoky war
28439 All hot and bleeding Will we offer them
28440 The mailed Mars Shall on his altar sit
28441 Up to the ears in blood I am on fire
28442 To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
28443 And yet not ours Come let me taste my horse
28444 Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
28445 Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales
28446 Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse
28447 Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse
28448 that Glendower were come
28449 Ver There is more news
28450 I learn'd in Worcester as I rode along
28451 He cannot draw his power this fourteen days
28452 Doug That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet
28453 Wor Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
28454 Hot What may the King's whole battle reach unto
28455 Ver To thirty thousand
28456 Hot Forty let it be
28457 My father and Glendower being both away
28458 The powers of us may serve so great a day
28459 Come let us take a muster speedily
28460 Doomsday is near Die all die merrily
28461 Doug Talk not of dying I am out of fear
28462 Of death or death's hand for this one halfyear
28463 Exeunt
28464 Scene II
28465 A public road near Coventry
28466 Enter Falstaff and Bardolph
28467 Fal Bardolph get thee before to Coventry fill me a bottle of
28468 sack Our soldiers shall march through We'll to Sutton Co'fil'
28469 tonight
28470 Bard Will you give me money Captain
28471 Fal Lay out lay out
28472 Bald This bottle makes an angel
28473 Fal An if it do take it for thy labour an if it make twenty
28474 take them all I'll answer the coinage Bid my lieutenant Peto
28475 meet me at town's end
28476 Bard I Will Captain Farewell Exit
28477 Fal If I be not ashamed of my soldiers I am a sous'd gurnet I
28478 have misused the King's press damnably I have got in exchange of
28479 a hundred and fifty soldiers three hundred and odd pounds I
28480 press me none but good householders yeomen's sons inquire me
28481 out contracted bachelors such as had been ask'd twice on the
28482 banes such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lieve hear the
28483 devil as a drum such as fear the report of a caliver worse than
28484 a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck I press'd me none but such
28485 toastsandbutter with hearts in their bellies no bigger than
28486 pins heads and they have bought out their services and now my
28487 whole charge consists of ancients corporals lieutenants
28488 gentlemen of companies slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
28489 painted cloth where the glutton's dogs licked his sores and
28490 such as indeed were never soldiers but discarded unjust
28491 servingmen younger sons to Younger brothers revolted tapsters
28492 and ostlers tradefall'n the cankers of a calm world and a long
28493 peace ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old fac'd
28494 ancient and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have
28495 bought out their services that you would think that I had a
28496 hundred and fifty tattered Prodigals lately come from
28497 swinekeeping from eating draff and husks A mad fellow met me
28498 on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and
28499 press'd the dead bodies No eye hath seen such scarecrows I'll
28500 not march through Coventry with them that's flat Nay and the
28501 villains march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on
28502 for indeed I had the most of them out of prison There's but a
28503 shirt and a half in all my company and the halfshirt is two
28504 napkins tack'd together and thrown over the shoulders like a
28505 herald's coat without sleeves and the shirt to say the truth
28506 stol'n from my host at Saint Alban's or the rednose innkeeper
28507 of Daventry But that's all one they'll find linen enough on
28508 every hedge
28509 Enter the Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland
28510 Prince How now blown Jack How now quilt
28511 Fal What Hal How now mad wag What a devil dost thou in
28512 Warwickshire My good Lord of Westmoreland I cry you mercy I

28515 you too but my powers are there already The King I can tell
28516 you looks for us all We must away all tonight
28517 Fal Tut never fear me I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream
28518 Prince I think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already
28519 made thee butter But tell me Jack whose fellows are these that
28520 come after
28521 Fal Mine Hal mine
28522 Prince I did never see such pitiful rascals
28523 Fal Tut tut good enough to toss food for powder food for
28524 powder They'll fill a pit as well as better Tush man mortal
28525 men mortal men
28526 West Ay but Sir John methinks they are exceeding poor and bare
28527 too beggarly
28528 Fal Faith for their poverty I know not where they had that and
28529 for their bareness I am surd they never learn'd that of me
28530 Prince No I'll be sworn unless you call three fingers on the
28531 ribs bare But sirrah make haste Percy 's already in the
28532 field
28533 Exit
28534 Fal What is the King encamp'd
28535 West He is Sir John I fear we shall stay too long
28536 [Exit]
28537 Fal Well
28538 To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
28539 Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest Exit
28540 Scene III
28541 The rebel camp near Shrewsbury
28542 Enter Hotspur Worcester Douglas Vernon
28543 Hot We'll fight with him tonight
28544 Wor It may not be
28545 Doug You give him then advantage
28546 Ver Not a whit

28550 Wor Good cousin be advis'd stir not tonight
28551 Ver Do not my lord
28552 Doug You do not counsel well
28553 You speak it out of fear and cold heart
28554 Ver Do me no slander Douglas By my life
28555 And I dare well maintain it with my life
28556 If wellrespected honour bid me on
28557 I hold as little counsel with weak fear
28558 As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives
28559 Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
28560 Which of us fears
28561 Doug Yea or tonight
28562 Ver Content
28563 Hot Tonight say I
28564 Come come it may not be I wonder much
28565 Being men of such great leading as you are
28566 That you foresee not what impediments
28567 Drag back our expedition Certain horse
28568 Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up
28569 Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today
28570 And now their pride and mettle is asleep
28571 Their courage with hard labour tame and dull
28572 That not a horse is half the half of himself
28573 Hot So are the horses of the enemy
28574 In general journeybated and brought low
28575 The better part of ours are full of rest
28576 Wor The number of the King exceedeth ours
28577 For God's sake cousin stay till all come in
28578 The trumpet sounds a parley
28579 Enter Sir Walter Blunt
28580 Blunt I come with gracious offers from the King
28581 If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
28582 Hot Welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God
28583 You were of our determination
28584 Some of us love you well and even those some
28585 Envy your great deservings and good name
28586 Because you are not of our quality
28587 But stand against us like an enemy
28588 Blunt And God defend but still I should stand so
28589 So long as out of limit and true rule
28590 You stand against anointed majesty
28591 But to my charge The King hath sent to know
28592 The nature of your griefs and whereupon
28593 You conjure from the breast of civil peace
28594 Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
28595 Audacious cruelty If that the King
28596 Have any way your good deserts forgot
28597 Which he confesseth to be manifold
28598 He bids you name your griefs and with all speed
28599 You shall have your desires with interest
28600 And pardon absolute for yourself and these
28601 Herein misled by your suggestion
28602 Hot The King is kind and well we know the King
28603 Knows at what time to promise when to pay
28604 My father and my uncle and myself
28605 Did give him that same royalty he wears
28606 And when he was not sixandtwenty strong
28607 Sick in the world's regard wretched and low
28608 A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
28609 My father gave him welcome to the shore
28610 And when he heard him swear and vow to God
28611 He came but to be Duke of Lancaster
28612 To sue his livery and beg his peace
28613 With tears of innocency and terms of zeal
28614 My father in kind heart and pity mov'd
28615 Swore him assistance and performed it too
28616 Now when the lords and barons of the realm
28617 Perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him
28618 The more and less came in with cap and knee
28619 Met him on boroughs cities villages
28620 Attended him on bridges stood in lanes
28621 Laid gifts before him proffer'd him their oaths
28622 Give him their heirs as pages followed him
28623 Even at the heels in golden multitudes
28624 He presently as greatness knows itself
28625 Steps me a little higher than his vow
28626 Made to my father while his blood was poor
28627 Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh
28628 And now forsooth takes on him to reform
28629 Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
28630 That lie too heavy on the commonwealth
28631 Cries out upon abuses seems to weep
28632 Over his country's wrongs and by this face
28633 This seeming brow of justice did he win
28634 The hearts of all that he did angle for
28635 Proceeded further cut me off the heads
28636 Of all the favourites that the absent King
28637 In deputation left behind him here
28638 When he was personal in the Irish war
28639 But Tut I came not to hear this
28640 Hot Then to the point
28641 In short time after lie depos'd the King
28642 Soon after that depriv'd him of his life
28643 And in the neck of that task'd the whole state
28644 To make that worse suff'red his kinsman March
28645 Who is if every owner were well placid
28646 Indeed his king to be engag'd in Wales
28647 There without ransom to lie forfeited
28648 Disgrac'd me in my happy victories
28649 Sought to entrap me by intelligence
28650 Rated mine uncle from the Council board
28651 In rage dismiss'd my father from the court
28652 Broke an oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
28653 And in conclusion drove us to seek out
28654 This head of safety and withal to pry
28655 Into his title the which we find
28656 Too indirect for long continuance
28657 Blunt Shall I return this answer to the King
28658 Hot Not so Sir Walter We'll withdraw awhile
28659 Go to the King and let there be impawn'd
28660 Some surety for a safe return again
28661 And In the morning early shall mine uncle
28662 Bring him our purposes and so farewell
28663 Blunt I would you would accept of grace and love
28664 Hot And may be so we shall
28665 Blunt Pray God you do
28666 Exeunt
28667 Scene IV
28668 York The Archbishop's Palace
28669 Enter the Archbishop of York and Sir Michael
28670 Arch Hie good Sir Michael bear this sealed brief
28671 With winged haste to the Lord Marshal
28672 This to my cousin Scroop and all the rest
28673 To whom they are directed If you knew
28674 How much they do import you would make haste
28675 Sir M My good lord
28676 I guess their tenour
28677 Arch Like enough you do
28678 Tomorrow good Sir Michael is a day
28679 Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
28680 Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury
28681 As I am truly given to understand
28682 The King with mighty and quickraised power
28683 Meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael
28684 What with the sickness of Northumberland
28685 Whose power was in the first proportion
28686 And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence
28687 Who with them was a rated sinew too
28688 And comes not in overrul'd by prophecies
28689 I fear the power of Percy is too weak
28690 To wage an instant trial with the King
28691 Sir M Why my good lord you need not fear
28692 There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer
28693 Arch No Mortimer is not there
28694 Sir M But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy
28695 And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
28696 Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
28697 Arch And so there is but yet the King hath drawn
28698 The special head of all the land together
28699 The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
28700 The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt
28701 And many moe corrivals and dear men
28702 Of estimation and command in arms
28703 Sir M Doubt not my lord they shall be well oppos'd
28704 Arch I hope no less yet needful 'tis to fear
28705 And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed
28706 For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the King
28707 Dismiss his power he means to visit us
28708 For he hath heard of our confederacy
28709 And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him
28710 Therefore make haste I must go write again
28711 To other friends and so farewell Sir Michael
28712 Exeunt

28721 ACT V Scene I
28722 The King's camp near Shrewsbury
28723 Enter the King Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster Sir Walter Blunt
28724 Falstaff
28725 King How bloodily the sun begins to peer
28726 Above yon busky hill The day looks pale
28727 At his distemp'rature
28728 Prince The southern wind
28729 Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
28730 And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
28731 Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day
28732 King Theft with the losers let it sympathize
28733 For nothing can seem foul to those that win
28734 The trumpet sounds Enter Worcester [and Vernon]
28735 How now my Lord of Worcester 'Tis not well
28736 That you and I should meet upon such terms
28737 As now we meet You have deceiv'd our trust
28738 And made us doff our easy robes of peace
28739 To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
28740 This is not well my lord this is not well
28741 What say you to it Will you again unknit
28742 This churlish knot of allabhorred war
28743 And move in that obedient orb again
28744 Where you did give a fair and natural light
28745 And be no more an exhal'd meteor
28746 A prodigy of fear and a portent
28747 Of broached mischief to the unborn times
28748 Wor Hear me my liege
28749 For mine own part I could be well content
28750 To entertain the lagend of my life
28751 With quiet hours for I do protest
28752 I have not sought the day of this dislike
28753 King You have not sought it How comes it then
28754 Fal Rebellion lay in his way and he found it
28755 Prince Peace chewet peace
28756 Wor It pleas'd your Majesty to turn your looks
28757 Of favour from myself and all our house
28758 And yet I must remember you my lord
28759 We were the first and dearest of your friends
28760 For you my staff of office did I break
28761 In Richard's time and posted day and night
28762 To meet you on the way and kiss your hand
28763 When yet you were in place and in account
28764 Nothing so strong and fortunate as I
28765 It was myself my brother and his son
28766 That brought you home and boldly did outdare
28767 The dangers of the time You swore to us
28768 And you did swear that oath at Doncaster
28769 That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state
28770 Nor claim no further than your newfall'n right
28771 The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster
28772 To this we swore our aid But in short space
28773 It it rain'd down fortune show'ring on your head
28774 And such a flood of greatness fell on you
28775 What with our help what with the absent King
28776 What with the injuries of a wanton time
28777 The seeming sufferances that you had borne
28778 And the contrarious winds that held the King
28779 So long in his unlucky Irish wars
28780 That all in England did repute him dead
28781 And from this swarm of fair advantages
28782 You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
28783 To gripe the general sway into your hand
28784 Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster
28785 And being fed by us you us'd us so
28786 As that ungentle gull the cuckoo's bird
28787 Useth the sparrow did oppress our nest
28788 Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
28789 That even our love thirst not come near your sight
28790 For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
28791 We were enforc'd for safety sake to fly
28792 Out of your sight and raise this present head
28793 Whereby we stand opposed by such means
28794 As you yourself have forg'd against yourself
28795 By unkind usage dangerous countenance
28796 And violation of all faith and troth
28797 Sworn to tis in your younger enterprise
28798 King These things indeed you have articulate
28799 Proclaim'd at market crosses read in churches
28800 To face the garment of rebellion
28801 With some fine colour that may please the eye
28802 Of fickle changelings and poor discontents
28803 Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
28804 Of hurlyburly innovation
28805 And never yet did insurrection want
28806 Such water colours to impaint his cause
28807 Nor moody beggars starving for a time
28808 Of pellmell havoc and confusion
28809 Prince In both our armies there is many a soul
28810 Shall pay full dearly for this encounter
28811 If once they join in trial Tell your nephew
28812 The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
28813 In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes
28814 This present enterprise set off his head
28815 I do not think a braver gentleman
28816 More activevaliant or more valiantyoung
28817 More daring or more bold is now alive
28818 To grace this latter age with noble deeds
28819 For my part I may speak it to my shame
28820 I have a truant been to chivalry
28821 And so I hear he doth account me too
28822 Yet this before my father's Majesty
28823 I am content that he shall take the odds
28824 Of his great name and estimation
28825 And will to save the blood on either side
28826 Try fortune with him in a single fight
28827 King And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee
28828 Albeit considerations infinite
28829 Do make against it No good Worcester no
28830 We love our people well even those we love
28831 That are misled upon your cousin's part
28832 And will they take the offer of our grace
28833 Both he and they and you yea every man
28834 Shall be my friend again and I'll be his
28835 So tell your cousin and bring me word
28836 What he will do But if he will not yield
28837 Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
28838 And they shall do their office So be gone
28839 We will not now be troubled with reply
28840 We offer fair take it advisedly
28841 Exit Worcester [with Vernon]
28842 Prince It will not be accepted on my life
28843 The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
28844 Are confident against the world in arms
28845 King Hence therefore every leader to his charge
28846 For on their answer will we set on them
28847 And God befriend us as our cause is just
28848 Exeunt Manent Prince Falstaff
28849 Fal Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so
28850 'Tis a point of friendship
28851 Prince Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship
28852 Say thy prayers and farewell
28853 Fal I would 'twere bedtime Hal and all well
28854 Prince Why thou owest God a death
28855 Exit
28856 Fal 'Tis not due yet I would be loath to pay him before his day
28857 What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me Well
28858 'tis no matter honour pricks me on Yea but how if honour prick
28859 me off when I come on How then Can honor set to a leg No Or
28860 an arm No Or take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no
28861 skill in surgery then No What is honour A word What is that
28862 word honour Air A trim reckoning Who hath it He that died a
28863 Wednesday Doth he feel it No Doth be bear it No 'Tis
28864 insensible then Yea to the dead But will it not live with the
28865 living No Why Detraction will not suffer it Therefore I'll
28866 none of it Honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism
28867 Exit
28868 Scene II
28869 The rebel camp
28870 Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon
28871 Wor O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard
28872 The liberal and kind offer of the King
28873 Ver 'Twere best he did
28874 Wor Then are we all undone
28875 It is not possible it cannot be
28876 The King should keep his word in loving us
28877 He will suspect us still and find a time
28878 To punish this offence in other faults
28879 Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
28880 For treason is but trusted like the fox
28881 Who ne'er so tame so cherish'd and lock'd up
28882 Will have a wild trick of his ancestors
28883 Look how we can or sad or merrily
28884 Interpretation will misquote our looks
28885 And we shall feed like oxen at a stall
28886 The better cherish'd still the nearer death
28887 My nephew's trespass may be well forgot
28888 It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
28889 And an adopted name of privilege
28890 A harebrained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen
28891 All his offences live upon my head
28892 And on his father's We did train him on
28893 And his corruption being taken from us
28894 We as the spring of all shall pay for all
28895 Therefore good cousin let not Harry know
28896 In any case the offer of the King
28897 Enter Hotspur [and Douglas]
28898 Ver Deliver what you will I'll say 'tis so
28899 Here comes your cousin
28900 Hot My uncle is return'd
28901 Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland
28902 Uncle what news
28903 Wor The King will bid you battle presently
28904 Doug Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland
28905 Hot Lord Douglas go you and tell him so
28906 Doug Marry and shall and very willingly
28907 Exit
28908 Wor There is no seeming mercy in the King
28909 Hot Did you beg any God forbid
28910 Wor I told him gently of our grievances
28911 Of his oathbreaking which he mended thus
28912 By now forswearing that he is forsworn
28913 He calls us rebels traitors aid will scourge
28914 With haughty arms this hateful name in us
28915 Enter Douglas
28916 Doug Arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown
28917 A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth
28918 And Westmoreland that was engag'd did bear it
28919 Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
28920 Wor The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the King
28921 And nephew challeng'd you to single fight
28922 Hot O would the quarrel lay upon our heads
28923 And that no man might draw short breath today
28924 But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me
28925 How show'd his tasking Seem'd it in contempt
28926 No by my soul I never in my life
28927 Did hear a challenge urg'd more modestly
28928 Unless a brother should a brother dare
28929 To gentle exercise and proof of arms
28930 He gave you all the duties of a man
28931 Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
28932 Spoke your deservings like a chronicle
28933 Making you ever better than his praise
28934 By still dispraising praise valued with you
28935 And which became him like a prince indeed
28936 He made a blushing cital of himself
28937 And chid his truant youth with such a grace
28938 As if lie mast'red there a double spirit
28939 Of teaching and of learning instantly
28940 There did he pause but let me tell the world
28941 If he outlive the envy of this day
28942 England did never owe so sweet a hope
28943 So much misconstrued in his wantonness
28944 Hot Cousin I think thou art enamoured
28945 Upon his follies Never did I hear
28946 Of any prince so wild a libertine
28947 But be he as he will yet once ere night
28948 I will embrace him with a soldier's arm
28949 That he shall shrink under my courtesy
28950 Arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
28951 Better consider what you have to do
28952 Than I that have not well the gift of tongue
28953 Can lift your blood up with persuasion
28954 Enter a Messenger
28955 Mess My lord here are letters for you
28956 Hot I cannot read them now
28957 O gentlemen the time of life is short
28958 To spend that shortness basely were too long
28959 If life did ride upon a dial's point
28960 Still ending at the arrival of an hour
28961 An if we live we live to tread on kings
28962 If die brave death when princes die with us
28963 Now for our consciences the arms are fair
28964 When the intent of bearing them is just
28965 Enter another Messenger
28966 Mess My lord prepare The King comes on apace
28967 Hot I thank him that he cuts me from my tale
28968 For I profess not talking Only this

28970 A sword whose temper I intend to stain
28971 With the best blood that I can meet withal
28972 In the adventure of this perilous day
28973 Now Esperance Percy and set on
28974 Sound all the lofty instruments of war
28975 And by that music let us all embrace
28976 For heaven to earth some of us never shall
28977 A second time do such a courtesy
28978 Here they embrace The trumpets sound

29100 They fight Douglas flieth
29101 Cheerly my lord How fares your Grace
29102 Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent
29103 And so hath Clifton I'll to Clifton straight
29104 King Stay and breathe awhile
29105 Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion
29106 And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life
29107 In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me
29108 Prince O God they did me too much injury
29109 That ever said I heark'ned for your death
29110 If it were so I might have let alone
29111 The insulting hand of Douglas over you
29112 Which would have been as speedy in your end
29113 As all the poisonous potions in the world
29114 And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son
29115 King Make up to Clifton I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey
29116 Exit
29117 Enter Hotspur
29118 Hot If I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth
29119 Prince Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name
29120 Hot My name is Harry Percy
29121 Prince Why then I see
29122 A very valiant rebel of the name
29123 I am the Prince of Wales and think not Percy
29124 To share with me in glory any more
29125 Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
29126 Nor can one England brook a double reign
29127 Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales
29128 Hot Nor shall it Harry for the hour is come
29129 To end the one of us and would to God
29130 Thy name in arms were now as great as mine
29131 Prince I'll make it greater ere I part from thee
29132 And all the budding honours on thy crest
29133 I'll crop to make a garland for my head
29134 Hot I can no longer brook thy vanities
29135 They fight
29136 Enter Falstaff
29137 Fal Well said Hal to it Hal Nay you shall find no boy's play
29138 here I can tell you
29139 Enter Douglas He fighteth with Falstaff who falls down as if
29140 he were dead [Exit Douglas] The Prince killeth Percy
29141 Hot O Harry thou hast robb'd me of my youth
29142 I better brook the loss of brittle life
29143 Than those proud titles thou hast won of me
29144 They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh
29145 But thoughts the slave of life and life time's fool
29146 And time that takes survey of all the world
29147 Must have a stop O I could prophesy
29148 But that the earthy and cold hand of death
29149 Lies on my tongue No Percy thou art dust
29150 And food for [Dies]
29151 Prince For worms brave Percy Fare thee well great heart
29152 Illweav'd ambition how much art thou shrunk
29153 When that this body did contain a spirit
29154 A kingdom for it was too small a bound
29155 But now two paces of the vilest earth
29156 Is room enough This earth that bears thee dead
29157 Bears not alive so stout a gentleman
29158 If thou wert sensible of courtesy
29159 I should not make so dear a show of zeal
29160 But let my favours hide thy mangled face
29161 And even in thy behalf I'll thank myself
29162 For doing these fair rites of tenderness
29163 Adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
29164 Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
29165 But not rememb'red in thy epitaph
29166 He spieth Falstaff on the ground
29167 What old acquaintance Could not all this flesh
29168 Keep in a little life Poor Jack farewell
29169 I could have better spar'd a better man
29170 O I should have a heavy miss of thee
29171 If I were much in love with vanity
29172 Death hath not struck so fat a deer today
29173 Though many dearer in this bloody fray
29174 Embowell'd will I see thee byandby
29175 Till then in blood by noble Percy lie Exit
29176 Falstaff riseth up
29177 Fal Embowell'd If thou embowel me today I'll give you leave to
29178 powder me and eat me too tomorrow 'Sblood 'twas time to
29179 counterfeit or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot
29180 too Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit To die is to be a
29181 counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not
29182 the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
29183 liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image
29184 of life indeed The better part of valour is discretion in the
29185 which better part I have saved my life Zounds I am afraid of
29186 this gunpowder Percy though he be dead How if he should
29187 counterfeit too and rise By my faith I am afraid he would
29188 prove the better counterfeit Therefore I'll make him sure yea
29189 and I'll swear I kill'd him Why may not he rise as well as I
29190 Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me Therefore
29191 sirrah [stabs him] with a new wound in your thigh come you
29192 along with me
29193 He takes up Hotspur on his hack [Enter Prince and John of
29194 Lancaster
29195 Prince Come brother John full bravely hast thou flesh'd
29196 Thy maiden sword
29197 John But soft whom have we here
29198 Did you not tell me this fat man was dead
29199 Prince I did I saw him dead
29200 Breathless and bleeding on the ground Art thou alive
29201 Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight
29202 I prithee speak We will not trust our eyes
29203 Without our ears Thou art not what thou seem'st
29204 Fal No that's certain I am not a double man but if I be not
29205 Jack Falstaff then am I a Jack There 's Percy If your father
29206 will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next Percy
29207 himself I look to be either earl or duke I can assure you
29208 Prince Why Percy I kill'd myself and saw thee dead
29209 Fal Didst thou Lord Lord how this world is given to lying I
29210 grant you I was down and out of breath and so was he but we
29211 rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury
29212 clock If I may be believ'd so if not let them that should
29213 reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads I'll take it
29214 upon my death I gave him this wound in the thigh If the man
29215 were alive and would deny it zounds I would make him eat a
29216 piece of my sword
29217 John This is the strangest tale that ever I beard
29218 Prince This is the strangest fellow brother John
29219 Come bring your luggage nobly on your back
29220 For my part if a lie may do thee grace
29221 I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have
29222 A retreat is sounded
29223 The trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
29224 Come brother let's to the highest of the field
29225 To see what friends are living who are dead
29226 Exeunt [Prince Henry and Prince John]
29227 Fal I'll follow as they say for reward He that rewards me God
29228 reward him If I do grow great I'll grow less for I'll purge
29229 and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do
29230 Exit [bearing off the body]
29231 Scene V
29232 Another part of the field
29233 The trumpets sound [Enter the King Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
29234 Earl of Westmoreland with Worcester and Vernon prisoners
29235 King Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke
29236 Illspirited Worcester did not we send grace
29237 Pardon and terms of love to all of you
29238 And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary
29239 Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust
29240 Three knights upon our party slain today
29241 A noble earl and many a creature else
29242 Had been alive this hour
29243 If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
29244 Betwixt our armies true intelligence
29245 Wor What I have done my safety urg'd me to
29246 And I embrace this fortune patiently
29247 Since not to be avoided it fails on me
29248 King Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too
29249 Other offenders we will pause upon
29250 Exeunt Worcester and Vernon [guarded]
29251 How goes the field
29252 Prince The noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw
29253 The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him
29254 The Noble Percy slain and all his men
29255 Upon the foot of fear fled with the rest
29256 And falling from a hillhe was so bruis'd
29257 That the pursuers took him At my tent
29258 The Douglas is and I beseech Your Grace
29259 I may dispose of him
29260 King With all my heart
29261 Prince Then brother John of Lancaster to you
29262 This honourable bounty shall belong
29263 Go to the Douglas and deliver him
29264 Up to his pleasure ransomless and free
29265 His valour shown upon our crests today
29266 Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
29267 Even in the bosom of our adversaries
29268 John I thank your Grace for this high courtesy
29269 Which I shall give away immediately
29270 King Then this remains that we divide our power
29271 You son John and my cousin Westmoreland

29348 RUMOUR Open your ears for which of you will stop
29349 The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks
29350 I from the orient to the drooping west
29351 Making the wind my posthorse still unfold
29352 The acts commenced on this ball of earth
29353 Upon my tongues continual slanders ride
29354 The which in every language I pronounce
29355 Stuffing the ears of men with false reports
29356 I speak of peace while covert emnity
29357 Under the smile of safety wounds the world
29358 And who but Rumour who but only I
29359 Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence
29360 Whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
29361 Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
29362 And no such matter Rumour is a pipe
29363 Blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
29364 And of so easy and so plain a stop
29365 That the blunt monster with uncounted heads
29366 The stilldiscordant wav'ring multitude
29367 Can play upon it But what need I thus
29368 My wellknown body to anatomize
29369 Among my household Why is Rumour here
29370 I run before King Harry's victory
29371 Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
29372 Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops
29373 Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
29374 Even with the rebels blood But what mean I
29375 To speak so true at first My office is
29376 To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
29377 Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword
29378 And that the King before the Douglas rage
29379 Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death
29380 This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
29381 Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
29382 And this wormeaten hold of ragged stone
29383 Where Hotspur's father old Northumberland
29384 Lies craftysick The posts come tiring on
29385 And not a man of them brings other news
29386 Than they have learnt of me From Rumour's tongues
29387 They bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs

29397 ACT I SCENE I
29398 Warkworth Before NORTHUMBERLAND'S Castle
29399 Enter LORD BARDOLPH
29400 LORD BARDOLPH Who keeps the gate here ho
29401 The PORTER opens the gate
29402 Where is the Earl
29403 PORTER What shall I say you are
29404 LORD BARDOLPH Tell thou the Earl
29405 That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here
29406 PORTER His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard
29407 Please it your honour knock but at the gate
29408 And he himself will answer
29409 Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
29410 LORD BARDOLPH Here comes the Earl Exit PORTER
29411 NORTHUMBERLAND What news Lord Bardolph Every minute now
29412 Should be the father of some stratagem
29413 The times are wild contention like a horse
29414 Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
29415 And bears down all before him
29416 LORD BARDOLPH Noble Earl
29417 I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury
29418 NORTHUMBERLAND Good an God will
29419 LORD BARDOLPH As good as heart can wish
29420 The King is almost wounded to the death
29421 And in the fortune of my lord your son
29422 Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts
29423 Kill'd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John
29424 And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field
29425 And Harry Monmouth's brawn the hulk Sir John
29426 Is prisoner to your son O such a day
29427 So fought so followed and so fairly won
29428 Came not till now to dignify the times
29429 Since Cxsar's fortunes
29430 NORTHUMBERLAND How is this deriv'd
29431 Saw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury
29432 LORD BARDOLPH I spake with one my lord that came from thence
29433 A gentleman well bred and of good name
29434 That freely rend'red me these news for true
29435 Enter TRAVERS
29436 NORTHUMBERLAND Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent
29437 On Tuesday last to listen after news
29438 LORD BARDOLPH My lord I overrode him on the way
29439 And he is furnish'd with no certainties
29440 More than he haply may retail from me
29441 NORTHUMBERLAND Now Travers what good tidings comes with you
29442 TRAVERS My lord Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
29443 With joyful tidings and being better hors'd
29444 Outrode me After him came spurring hard
29445 A gentleman almost forspent with speed
29446 That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse
29447 He ask'd the way to Chester and of him
29448 I did demand what news from Shrewsbury
29449 He told me that rebellion had bad luck
29450 And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold
29451 With that he gave his able horse the head
29452 And bending forward struck his armed heels
29453 Against the panting sides of his poor jade
29454 Up to the rowelhead and starting so
29455 He seem'd in running to devour the way
29456 Staying no longer question
29457 NORTHUMBERLAND Ha Again
29458 Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold
29459 Of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion
29460 Had met ill luck
29461 LORD BARDOLPH My lord I'll tell you what
29462 If my young lord your son have not the day
29463 Upon mine honour for a silken point
29464 I'll give my barony Never talk of it
29465 NORTHUMBERLAND Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
29466 Give then such instances of loss
29467 LORD BARDOLPH Who he
29468 He was some hilding fellow that had stol'n
29469 The horse he rode on and upon my life
29470 Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news
29471 Enter Morton
29472 NORTHUMBERLAND Yea this man's brow like to a titleleaf
29473 Foretells the nature of a tragic volume
29474 So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
29475 Hath left a witness'd usurpation
29476 Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury
29477 MORTON I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord
29478 Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
29479 To fright our party
29480 NORTHUMBERLAND How doth my son and brother
29481 Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
29482 Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
29483 Even such a man so faint so spiritless
29484 So dull so dread in look so woebegone
29485 Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night
29486 And would have told him half his Troy was burnt
29487 But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue
29488 And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it
29489 This thou wouldst say 'Your son did thus and thus
29490 Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas'
29491 Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
29492 But in the end to stop my ear indeed
29493 Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
29494 Ending with 'Brother son and all are dead'
29495 MORTON Douglas is living and your brother yet
29496 But for my lord your son
29497 NORTHUMBERLAND Why he is dead
29498 See what a ready tongue suspicion hath
29499 He that but fears the thing he would not know
29500 Hath by instinct knowledge from others eyes
29501 That what he fear'd is chanced Yet speak Morton
29502 Tell thou an earl his divination lies
29503 And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
29504 And make thee rich for doing me such wrong
29505 MORTON You are too great to be by me gainsaid
29506 Your spirit is too true your fears too certain
29507 NORTHUMBERLAND Yet for all this say not that Percy's dead
29508 I see a strange confession in thine eye
29509 Thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
29510 To speak a truth If he be slain say so
29511 The tongue offends not that reports his death
29512 And he doth sin that doth belie the dead
29513 Not he which says the dead is not alive
29514 Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
29515 Hath but a losing office and his tongue
29516 Sounds ever after as a sullen bell
29517 Rememb'red tolling a departing friend
29518 LORD BARDOLPH I cannot think my lord your son is dead
29519 MORTON I am sorry I should force you to believe
29520 That which I would to God I had not seen
29521 But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
29522 Rend'ring faint quittance wearied and outbreath'd
29523 To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
29524 The neverdaunted Percy to the earth
29525 From whence with life he never more sprung up
29526 In few his death whose spirit lent a fire
29527 Even to the dullest peasant in his camp
29528 Being bruited once took fire and heat away
29529 From the besttemper'd courage in his troops
29530 For from his metal was his party steeled
29531 Which once in him abated an the rest
29532 Turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead
29533 And as the thing that's heavy in itself
29534 Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
29535 So did our men heavy in Hotspur's loss
29536 Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
29537 That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
29538 Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
29539 Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester
29540 Too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious Scot
29541 The bloody Douglas whose welllabouring sword
29542 Had three times slain th appearance of the King
29543 Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
29544 Of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight
29545 Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all
29546 Is that the King hath won and hath sent out
29547 A speedy power to encounter you my lord
29548 Under the conduct of young Lancaster
29549 And Westmoreland This is the news at full
29550 NORTHUMBERLAND For this I shall have time enough to mourn
29551 In poison there is physic and these news
29552 Having been well that would have made me sick
29553 Being sick have in some measure made me well
29554 And as the wretch whose feverweak'ned joints
29555 Like strengthless hinges buckle under life
29556 Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
29557 Out of his keeper's arms even so my limbs
29558 Weak'ned with grief being now enrag'd with grief
29559 Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch
29560 A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
29561 Must glove this hand and hence thou sickly coif
29562 Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
29563 Which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit
29564 Now bind my brows with iron and approach
29565 The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
29566 To frown upon th enrag'd Northumberland
29567 Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Nature's hand
29568 Keep the wild flood confin'd Let order die
29569 And let this world no longer be a stage
29570 To feed contention in a ling'ring act
29571 But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain
29572 Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
29573 On bloody courses the rude scene may end
29574 And darkness be the burier of the dead
29575 LORD BARDOLPH This strained passion doth you wrong my lord
29576 MORTON Sweet Earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
29577 The lives of all your loving complices
29578 Lean on your health the which if you give o'er
29579 To stormy passion must perforce decay
29580 You cast th event of war my noble lord
29581 And summ'd the account of chance before you said
29582 'Let us make head It was your presurmise
29583 That in the dole of blows your son might drop
29584 You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge
29585 More likely to fall in than to get o'er
29586 You were advis'd his flesh was capable
29587 Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
29588 Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd
29589 Yet did you say 'Go forth and none of this
29590 Though strongly apprehended could restrain
29591 The stiffborne action What hath then befall'n
29592 Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
29593 More than that being which was like to be
29594 LORD BARDOLPH We all that are engaged to this loss
29595 Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
29596 That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one
29597 And yet we ventur'd for the gain propos'd
29598 Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd
29599 And since we are o'erset venture again
29600 Come we will put forth body and goods
29601 MORTON 'Tis more than time And my most noble lord
29602 I hear for certain and dare speak the truth
29603 The gentle Archbishop of York is up
29604 With wellappointed pow'rs He is a man
29605 Who with a double surety binds his followers
29606 My lord your son had only but the corpse
29607 But shadows and the shows of men to fight
29608 For that same word 'rebellion did divide
29609 The action of their bodies from their souls
29610 And they did fight with queasiness constrain'd
29611 As men drink potions that their weapons only
29612 Seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls
29613 This word 'rebellion it had froze them up
29614 As fish are in a pond But now the Bishop
29615 Turns insurrection to religion
29616 Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts
29617 He's follow'd both with body and with mind
29618 And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
29619 Of fair King Richard scrap'd from Pomfret stones
29620 Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
29621 Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
29622 Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke
29623 And more and less do flock to follow him
29624 NORTHUMBERLAND I knew of this before but to speak truth
29625 This present grief had wip'd it from my mind
29626 Go in with me and counsel every man
29627 The aptest way for safety and revenge
29628 Get posts and letters and make friends with speed
29629 Never so few and never yet more need Exeunt
29630 SCENE II
29631 London A street
29632 Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler
29633 FALSTAFF Sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
29634 PAGE He said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but
29635 for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he
29636 knew for
29637 FALSTAFF Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me The brain of
29638 this foolishcompounded clay man is not able to invent anything
29639 that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on
29640 me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in
29641 other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath
29642 overwhelm'd all her litter but one If the Prince put thee into
29643 my service for any other reason than to set me off why then I
29644 have no judgment Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be
29645 worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never mann'd with
29646 an agate till now but I will inset you neither in gold nor
29647 silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your
29648 master for a jewel the juvenal the Prince your master whose
29649 chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the
29650 palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he
29651 will not stick to say his face is a faceroyal God may finish it
29652 when he will 'tis not a hair amiss yet He may keep it still at
29653 a faceroyal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it
29654 and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his
29655 father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but he's almost
29656 out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton about
29657 the satin for my short cloak and my slops
29658 PAGE He said sir you should procure him better assurance than
29659 Bardolph He would not take his band and yours he liked not the
29660 security
29661 FALSTAFF Let him be damn'd like the Glutton pray God his tongue
29662 be hotter A whoreson Achitophel A rascalyeaforsooth knave to
29663 bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The
29664 whoreson smoothpates do now wear nothing but high shoes and
29665 bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with
29666 them in honest takingup then they must stand upon security I
29667 had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop
29668 it with security I look'd 'a should have sent me two and twenty
29669 yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security
29670 Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of
29671 abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and
29672 yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
29673 Where's Bardolph
29674 PAGE He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horse
29675 FALSTAFF I bought him in Paul's and he'll buy me a horse in
29676 Smithfield An I could get me but a wife in the stews I were
29677 mann'd hors'd and wiv'd
29678 Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT
29679 PAGE Sir here comes the nobleman that committed the
29680 Prince for striking him about Bardolph

29692 CHIEF JUSTICE I am sure he is to the hearing of anything good
29693 Go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with him
29694 SERVANT Sir John
29695 FALSTAFF What a young knave and begging Is there not wars Is
29696 there not employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not the
29697 rebels need soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but
29698 one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were
29699 it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it
29700 SERVANT You mistake me sir
29701 FALSTAFF Why sir did I say you were an honest man Setting my
29702 knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I
29703 had said so
29704 SERVANT I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your
29705 soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you in your
29706 throat if you say I am any other than an honest man
29707 FALSTAFF I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which
29708 grows to me If thou get'st any leave of me hang me if thou
29709 tak'st leave thou wert better be hang'd You hunt counter
29710 Hence Avaunt
29711 SERVANT Sir my lord would speak with you
29712 CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John Falstaff a word with you
29713 FALSTAFF My good lord God give your lordship good time of day I
29714 am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship
29715 was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice Your
29716 lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack
29717 of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I most
29718 humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your
29719 health
29720 CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John I sent for you before your expedition to
29721 Shrewsbury
29722 FALSTAFF An't please your lordship I hear his Majesty is return'd
29723 with some discomfort from Wales
29724 CHIEF JUSTICE I talk not of his Majesty You would not come when I
29725 sent for you
29726 FALSTAFF And I hear moreover his Highness is fall'n into this
29727 same whoreson apoplexy
29728 CHIEF JUSTICE Well God mend him I pray you let me speak with you
29729 FALSTAFF This apoplexy as I take it is a kind of lethargy an't
29730 please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson
29731 tingling
29732 CHIEF JUSTICE What tell you me of it Be it as it is
29733 FALSTAFF It hath it original from much grief from study and
29734 perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his effects
29735 in Galen it is a kind of deafness
29736 CHIEF JUSTICE I think you are fall'n into the disease for you
29737 hear not what I say to you
29738 FALSTAFF Very well my lord very well Rather an't please you it
29739 is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that
29740 I am troubled withal
29741 CHIEF JUSTICE To punish you by the heels would amend the attention
29742 of your ears and I care not if I do become your physician
29743 FALSTAFF I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient Your
29744 lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect
29745 of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your
29746 prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or
29747 indeed a scruple itself
29748 CHIEF JUSTICE I sent for you when there were matters against you
29749 for your life to come speak with me
29750 FALSTAFF As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws
29751 of this landservice I did not come
29752 CHIEF JUSTICE Well the truth is Sir John you live in great
29753 infamy
29754 FALSTAFF He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less
29755 CHIEF JUSTICE Your means are very slender and your waste is
29756 great
29757 FALSTAFF I would it were otherwise I would my means were greater
29758 and my waist slenderer
29759 CHIEF JUSTICE You have misled the youthful Prince
29760 FALSTAFF The young Prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the
29761 great belly and he my dog
29762 CHIEF JUSTICE Well I am loath to gall a newheal'd wound Your
29763 day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your
29764 night's exploit on Gadshill You may thank th unquiet time for
29765 your quiet o'erposting that action
29766 FALSTAFF My lord
29767 CHIEF JUSTICE But since all is well keep it so wake not a
29768 sleeping wolf
29769 FALSTAFF To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox
29770 CHIEF JUSTICE What you are as a candle the better part burnt
29771 out
29772 FALSTAFF A wassail candle my lord all tallow if I did say of
29773 wax my growth would approve the truth
29774 CHIEF JUSTICE There is not a white hair in your face but should
29775 have his effect of gravity
29776 FALSTAFF His effect of gravy gravy
29777 CHIEF JUSTICE You follow the young Prince up and down like his
29778 ill angel
29779 FALSTAFF Not so my lord Your ill angel is light but hope he
29780 that looks upon me will take me without weighing And yet in some
29781 respects I grant I cannot go I cannot tell Virtue is of so
29782 little regard in these costermongers times that true valour is
29783 turn'd berod pregnancy is made a tapster and his quick wit
29784 wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to
29785 man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a
29786 gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of us
29787 that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the
29788 bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our
29789 youth must confess are wags too
29790 CHIEF JUSTICE Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth
29791 that are written down old with all the characters of age Have
29792 you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a
29793 decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice broken
29794 your wind short your chin double your wit single and every
29795 part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call
29796 yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John
29797 FALSTAFF My lord I was born about three of the clock in the
29798 afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For my
29799 voice I have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems To
29800 approve my youth further I will not The truth is I am only old
29801 in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for
29802 a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him For
29803 the box of the ear that the Prince gave you he gave it like a
29804 rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord I have check'd
29805 him for it and the young lion repents marry not in ashes and
29806 sackcloth but in new silk and old sack
29807 CHIEF JUSTICE Well God send the Prince a better companion
29808 FALSTAFF God send the companion a better prince I cannot rid my
29809 hands of him
29810 CHIEF JUSTICE Well the King hath sever'd you I hear you are
29811 going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the
29812 Earl of Northumberland
29813 FALSTAFF Yea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look you
29814 pray all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home that our armies
29815 join not in a hot day for by the Lord I take but two shirts
29816 out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily If it be a
29817 hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle I would I might
29818 never spit white again There is not a dangerous action can peep
29819 out his head but I am thrust upon it Well I cannot last ever
29820 but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation if they
29821 have a good thing to make it too common If ye will needs say I
29822 am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name
29823 were not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be
29824 eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with
29825 perpetual motion
29826 CHIEF JUSTICE Well be honest be honest and God bless your
29827 expedition
29828 FALSTAFF Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me
29829 forth
29830 CHIEF JUSTICE Not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
29831 bear crosses Fare you well Commend me to my cousin
29832 Westmoreland
29833 Exeunt CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT
29834 FALSTAFF If I do fillip me with a threeman beetle A man can no
29835 more separate age and covetousness than 'a can part young limbs
29836 and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the
29837 other and so both the degrees prevent my curses Boy
29838 PAGE Sir
29839 FALSTAFF What money is in my purse
29840 PAGE Seven groats and two pence
29841 FALSTAFF I can get no remedy against this consumption of the
29842 purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease
29843 is incurable Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster this
29844 to the Prince this to the Earl of Westmoreland and this to old
29845 Mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I
29846 perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin About it you know
29847 where to find me [Exit PAGE] A pox of this gout or a gout of
29848 this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
29849 toe 'Tis no matter if I do halt I have the wars for my colour
29850 and my pension shall seem the more reasonable A good wit will
29851 make use of anything I will turn diseases to commodity
29852 Exit
29853 SCENE III
29854 York The ARCHBISHOP'S palace
29855 Enter the ARCHBISHOP THOMAS MOWBRAY the EARL MARSHAL LORD HASTINGS
29856 and LORD BARDOLPH
29857 ARCHBISHOP Thus have you heard our cause and known our means
29858 And my most noble friends I pray you all
29859 Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes
29860 And first Lord Marshal what say you to it
29861 MOWBRAY I well allow the occasion of our amis
29862 But gladly would be better satisfied
29863 How in our means we should advance ourselves
29864 To look with forehead bold and big enough
29865 Upon the power and puissance of the King
29866 HASTINGS Our present musters grow upon the file
29867 To five and twenty thousand men of choice
29868 And our supplies live largely in the hope
29869 Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns
29870 With an incensed fire of injuries
29871 LORD BARDOLPH The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus
29872 Whether our present five and twenty thousand
29873 May hold up head without Northumberland
29874 HASTINGS With him we may
29875 LORD BARDOLPH Yea marry there's the point
29876 But if without him we be thought too feeble
29877 My judgment is we should not step too far
29878 Till we had his assistance by the hand
29879 For in a theme so bloodyfac'd as this
29880 Conjecture expectation and surmise
29881 Of aids incertain should not be admitted
29882 ARCHBISHOP 'Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed
29883 It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury
29884 LORD BARDOLPH It was my lord who lin'd himself with hope
29885 Eating the air and promise of supply
29886 Flatt'ring himself in project of a power
29887 Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
29888 And so with great imagination
29889 Proper to madmen led his powers to death
29890 And winking leapt into destruction
29891 HASTINGS But by your leave it never yet did hurt
29892 To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
29893 LORD BARDOLPH Yes if this present quality of war
29894 Indeed the instant action a cause on foot
29895 Lives so in hope as in an early spring
29896 We see th appearing buds which to prove fruit
29897 Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
29898 That frosts will bite them When we mean to build
29899 We first survey the plot then draw the model
29900 And when we see the figure of the house
29901 Then we must rate the cost of the erection
29902 Which if we find outweighs ability
29903 What do we then but draw anew the model
29904 In fewer offices or at least desist
29905 To build at all Much more in this great work
29906 Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
29907 And set another up should we survey
29908 The plot of situation and the model
29909 Consent upon a sure foundation
29910 Question surveyors know our own estate
29911 How able such a work to undergo
29912 To weigh against his opposite or else
29913 We fortify in paper and in figures
29914 Using the names of men instead of men
29915 Like one that draws the model of a house
29916 Beyond his power to build it who half through
29917 Gives o'er and leaves his partcreated cost
29918 A naked subject to the weeping clouds
29919 And waste for churlish winter's tyranny
29920 HASTINGS Grant that our hopes yet likely of fair birth
29921 Should be stillborn and that we now possess'd
29922 The utmost man of expectation
29923 I think we are so a body strong enough
29924 Even as we are to equal with the King
29925 LORD BARDOLPH What is the King but five and twenty thousand
29926 HASTINGS To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph
29927 For his divisions as the times do brawl
29928 Are in three heads one power against the French
29929 And one against Glendower perforce a third
29930 Must take up us So is the unfirm King
29931 In three divided and his coffers sound
29932 With hollow poverty and emptiness
29933 ARCHBISHOP That he should draw his several strengths together
29934 And come against us in full puissance
29935 Need not be dreaded
29936 HASTINGS If he should do so
29937 He leaves his back unarm'd the French and Welsh
29938 Baying at his heels Never fear that
29939 LORD BARDOLPH Who is it like should lead his forces hither
29940 HASTINGS The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland
29941 Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth
29942 But who is substituted against the French
29943 I have no certain notice
29944 ARCHBISHOP Let us on
29945 And publish the occasion of our arms
29946 The commonwealth is sick of their own choice
29947 Their overgreedy love hath surfeited
29948 An habitation giddy and unsure
29949 Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
29950 O thou fond many with what loud applause
29951 Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
29952 Before he was what thou wouldst have him be
29953 And being now trimm'd in thine own desires
29954 Thou beastly feeder art so full of him
29955 That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up
29956 So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
29957 Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard
29958 And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
29959 And howl'st to find it What trust is in these times
29960 They that when Richard liv'd would have him die
29961 Are now become enamour'd on his grave
29962 Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
29963 When through proud London he came sighing on
29964 After th admired heels of Bolingbroke
29965 Criest now 'O earth yield us that king again
29966 And take thou this O thoughts of men accurs'd
29967 Past and to come seems best things present worst
29968 MOWBRAY Shall we go draw our numbers and set on
29969 HASTINGS We are time's subjects and time bids be gone
29970 Exeunt

30152 POINS Is't come to that I had thought weariness durst not have
30153 attach'd one of so high blood
30154 PRINCE Faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of
30155 my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me to
30156 desire small beer
30157 POINS Why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to
30158 remember so weak a composition
30159 PRINCE Belike then my appetite was notprincely got for by my
30160 troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But
30161 indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my
30162 greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or
30163 to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk
30164 stockings thou hast viz these and those that were thy
30165 peachcolour'd ones or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as
30166 one for superfluity and another for use But that the
30167 tenniscourtkeeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of
30168 linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast
30169 not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries
30170 have made a shift to eat up thy holland And God knows whether
30171 those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his
30172 kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault
30173 whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily
30174 strengthened
30175 POINS How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you
30176 should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would
30177 do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is

30184 my father is sick albeit I could tell to thee as to one it
30185 pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend I could be
30186 sad and sad indeed too
30187 POINS Very hardly upon such a subject
30188 PRINCE By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book
30189 as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end
30190 try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my
30191 father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath
30192 in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
30193 POINS The reason
30194 PRINCE What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep
30195 POINS I would think thee a most princely hypocrite
30196 PRINCE It would be every man's thought and thou art a blessed
30197 fellow to think as every man thinks Never a man's thought in the
30198 world keeps the roadway better than thine Every man would think
30199 me an hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful
30200 thought to think so
30201 POINS Why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to
30202 Falstaff
30203 PRINCE And to thee
30204 POINS By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine
30205 own ears The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second
30206 brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those two
30207 things I confess I cannot help By the mass here comes

30313 NORTHUMBERLAND Alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
30314 And but my going nothing can redeem it
30315 LADY PERCY O yet for God's sake go not to these wars
30316 The time was father that you broke your word
30317 When you were more endear'd to it than now
30318 When your own Percy when my heart's dear Harry
30319 Threw many a northward look to see his father
30320 Bring up his powers but he did long in vain
30321 Who then persuaded you to stay at home
30322 There were two honours lost yours and your son's
30323 For yours the God of heaven brighten it
30324 For his it stuck upon him as the sun
30325 In the grey vault of heaven and by his light
30326 Did all the chivalry of England move
30327 To do brave acts He was indeed the glass
30328 Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
30329 He had no legs that practis'd not his gait
30330 And speaking thick which nature made his blemish
30331 Became the accents of the valiant
30332 For those who could speak low and tardily
30333 Would turn their own perfection to abuse
30334 To seem like him so that in speech in gait
30335 In diet in affections of delight
30336 In military rules humours of blood
30337 He was the mark and glass copy and book
30338 That fashion'd others And him O wondrous him
30339 O miracle of men him did you leave
30340 Second to none unseconded by you
30341 To look upon the hideous god of war
30342 In disadvantage to abide a field
30343 Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name

30353 Fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me

30749 Westminster The palace
30750 Enter the KING in his nightgown with a page
30751 KING Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick
30752 But ere they come bid them o'erread these letters
30753 And well consider of them Make good speed Exit page
30754 How many thousands of my poorest subjects
30755 Are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep
30756 Nature's soft nurse how have I frightened thee
30757 That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down
30758 And steep my senses in forgetfulness
30759 Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
30760 Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
30761 And hush'd with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber
30762 Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great
30763 Under the canopies of costly state
30764 And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody
30765 O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
30766 In loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch
30767 A watchcase or a common 'larumbell
30768 Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
30769 Seal up the shipboy's eyes and rock his brains
30770 In cradle of the rude imperious surge
30771 And in the visitation of the winds
30772 Who take the ruffian billows by the top
30773 Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
30774 With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds
30775 That with the hurly death itself awakes
30776 Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose
30777 To the wet seaboy in an hour so rude
30778 And in the calmest and most stillest night
30779 With all appliances and means to boot
30780 Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down
30781 Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
30782 Enter WARWICK and Surrey
30783 WARWICK Many good morrows to your Majesty
30784 KING Is it good morrow lords
30785 WARWICK 'Tis one o'clock and past
30786 KING Why then good morrow to you all my lords
30787 Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you
30788 WARWICK We have my liege
30789 KING Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
30790 How foul it is what rank diseases grow
30791 And with what danger near the heart of it
30792 WARWICK It is but as a body yet distempered
30793 Which to his former strength may be restored
30794 With good advice and little medicine
30795 My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd
30796 KING O God that one might read the book of fate
30797 And see the revolution of the times
30798 Make mountains level and the continent
30799 Weary of solid firmness melt itself
30800 Into the sea and other times to see
30801 The beachy girdle of the ocean
30802 Too wide for Neptune's hips how chances mock
30803 And changes fill the cup of alteration
30804 With divers liquors O if this were seen
30805 The happiest youth viewing his progress through
30806 What perils past what crosses to ensue
30807 Would shut the book and sit him down and die
30808 'Tis not ten years gone
30809 Since Richard and Northumberland great friends
30810 Did feast together and in two years after
30811 Were they at wars It is but eight years since
30812 This Percy was the man nearest my soul
30813 Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
30814 And laid his love and life under my foot
30815 Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard
30816 Gave him defiance But which of you was by
30817 [To WARWICK] You cousin Nevil as I may remember
30818 When Richard with his eye brim full of tears
30819 Then check'd and rated by Northumberland
30820 Did speak these words now prov'd a prophecy
30821 'Northumberland thou ladder by the which
30822 My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'
30823 Though then God knows I had no such intent
30824 But that necessity so bow'd the state
30825 That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss
30826 'The time shall come thus did he follow it
30827 'The time will come that foul sin gathering head
30828 Shall break into corruption so went on
30829 Foretelling this same time's condition
30830 And the division of our amity
30831 WARWICK There is a history in all men's lives
30832 Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd
30833 The which observ'd a man may prophesy
30834 With a near aim of the main chance of things
30835 As yet not come to life who in their seeds
30836 And weak beginning lie intreasured
30837 Such things become the hatch and brood of time
30838 And by the necessary form of this
30839 King Richard might create a perfect guess
30840 That great Northumberland then false to him
30841 Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
30842 Which should not find a ground to root upon
30843 Unless on you
30844 KING Are these things then necessities
30845 Then let us meet them like necessities
30846 And that same word even now cries out on us
30847 They say the Bishop and Northumberland
30848 Are fifty thousand strong
30849 WARWICK It cannot be my lord
30850 Rumour doth double like the voice and echo
30851 The numbers of the feared Please it your Grace
30852 To go to bed Upon my soul my lord
30853 The powers that you already have sent forth
30854 Shall bring this prize in very easily
30855 To comfort you the more I have receiv'd
30856 A certain instance that Glendower is dead
30857 Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill
30858 And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad
30859 Unto your sickness
30860 KING I will take your counsel
30861 And were these inward wars once out of hand
30862 We would dear lords unto the Holy Land Exeunt

31127 return I will fetch off these justices I do see the bottom of
31128 justice Shallow Lord Lord how subject we old men are to this
31129 vice of lying This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but
31130 prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath
31131 done about Turnbull Street and every third word a lie duer paid
31132 to the hearer than the Turk's tribute I do remember him at
31133 Clement's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheeseparing
31134 When 'a was naked he was for all the world like a fork'd radish
31135 with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife 'A was so
31136 forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible 'A
31137 was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the
31138 whores call'd him mandrake 'A came ever in the rearward of the
31139 fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that
31140 he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or
31141 his goodnights And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire
31142 and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn
31143 brother to him and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in
31144 the Tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the
31145 marshal's men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own
31146 name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an
31147 eelskin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a
31148 court and now has he land and beeves Well I'll be acquainted
31149 with him if I return and 't shall go hard but I'll make him a
31150 philosopher's two stones to me If the young dace be a bait for
31151 the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap
31152 at him Let time shape and there an end Exit

31161 ACT IV SCENE I
31162 Yorkshire Within the Forest of Gaultree
31163 Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK MOWBRAY HASTINGS and others
31164 ARCHBISHOP What is this forest call'd
31165 HASTINGS 'Tis Gaultree Forest an't shall please your Grace
31166 ARCHBISHOP Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
31167 To know the numbers of our enemies
31168 HASTINGS We have sent forth already
31169 ARCHBISHOP 'Tis well done
31170 My friends and brethren in these great affairs
31171 I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd
31172 Newdated letters from Northumberland
31173 Their cold intent tenour and substance thus
31174 Here doth he wish his person with such powers
31175 As might hold sortance with his quality
31176 The which he could not levy whereupon
31177 He is retir'd to ripe his growing fortunes
31178 To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
31179 That your attempts may overlive the hazard
31180 And fearful meeting of their opposite
31181 MOWBRAY Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
31182 And dash themselves to pieces
31183 Enter A MESSENGER
31184 HASTINGS Now what news
31185 MESSENGER West of this forest scarcely off a mile
31186 In goodly form comes on the enemy
31187 And by the ground they hide I judge their number
31188 Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
31189 MOWBRAY The just proportion that we gave them out
31190 Let us sway on and face them in the field
31191 Enter WESTMORELAND
31192 ARCHBISHOP What wellappointed leader fronts us here
31193 MOWBRAY I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland
31194 WESTMORELAND Health and fair greeting from our general
31195 The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster
31196 ARCHBISHOP Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace
31197 What doth concern your coming
31198 WESTMORELAND Then my lord
31199 Unto your Grace do I in chief address
31200 The substance of my speech If that rebellion
31201 Came like itself in base and abject routs
31202 Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
31203 And countenanc'd by boys and beggary
31204 I say if damn'd commotion so appear'd
31205 In his true native and most proper shape
31206 You reverend father and these noble lords
31207 Had not been here to dress the ugly form
31208 Of base and bloody insurrection
31209 With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop
31210 Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd
31211 Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd
31212 Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd
31213 Whose white investments figure innocence
31214 The dove and very blessed spirit of peace
31215 Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself
31216 Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
31217 Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war
31218 Turning your books to graves your ink to blood
31219 Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
31220 To a loud trumpet and a point of war
31221 ARCHBISHOP Wherefore do I this So the question stands
31222 Briefly to this end we are all diseas'd
31223 And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
31224 Have brought ourselves into a burning fever
31225 And we must bleed for it of which disease
31226 Our late King Richard being infected died
31227 But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland
31228 I take not on me here as a physician
31229 Nor do I as an enemy to peace
31230 Troop in the throngs of military men
31231 But rather show awhile like fearful war
31232 To diet rank minds sick of happiness
31233 And purge th obstructions which begin to stop
31234 Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly
31235 I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
31236 What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
31237 And find our griefs heavier than our offences
31238 We see which way the stream of time doth run
31239 And are enforc'd from our most quiet there
31240 By the rough torrent of occasion
31241 And have the summary of all our griefs
31242 When time shall serve to show in articles
31243 Which long ere this we offer'd to the King
31244 And might by no suit gain our audience
31245 When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs
31246 We are denied access unto his person
31247 Even by those men that most have done us wrong
31248 The dangers of the days but newly gone
31249 Whose memory is written on the earth
31250 With yet appearing blood and the examples
31251 Of every minute's instance present now
31252 Hath put us in these illbeseeming arms
31253 Not to break peace or any branch of it
31254 But to establish here a peace indeed
31255 Concurring both in name and quality
31256 WESTMORELAND When ever yet was your appeal denied
31257 Wherein have you been galled by the King
31258 What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you
31259 That you should seal this lawless bloody book
31260 Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine
31261 And consecrate commotion's bitter edge
31262 ARCHBISHOP My brother general the commonwealth
31263 To brother horn an household cruelty
31264 I make my quarrel in particular
31265 WESTMORELAND There is no need of any such redress
31266 Or if there were it not belongs to you
31267 MOWBRAY Why not to him in part and to us all
31268 That feel the bruises of the days before
31269 And suffer the condition of these times
31270 To lay a heavy and unequal hand
31271 Upon our honours
31272 WESTMORELAND O my good Lord Mowbray
31273 Construe the times to their necessities
31274 And you shall say indeed it is the time
31275 And not the King that doth you injuries
31276 Yet for your part it not appears to me
31277 Either from the King or in the present time
31278 That you should have an inch of any ground
31279 To build a grief on Were you not restor'd
31280 To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories
31281 Your noble and right wellrememb'red father's
31282 MOWBRAY What thing in honour had my father lost
31283 That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me
31284 The King that lov'd him as the state stood then
31285 Was force perforce compell'd to banish him
31286 And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he
31287 Being mounted and both roused in their seats
31288 Their neighing coursers daring of the spur
31289 Their armed staves in charge their beavers down
31290 Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
31291 And the loud trumpet blowing them together
31292 Then then when there was nothing could have stay'd
31293 My father from the breast of Bolingbroke
31294 O when the King did throw his warder down
31295 His own life hung upon the staff he threw
31296 Then threw he down himself and all their lives
31297 That by indictment and by dint of sword
31298 Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke
31299 WESTMORELAND You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what
31300 The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
31301 In England the most valiant gentleman
31302 Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd
31303 But if your father had been victor there
31304 He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry
31305 For all the country in a general voice
31306 Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
31307 Were set on Hereford whom they doted on
31308 And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King
31309 But this is mere digression from my purpose
31310 Here come I from our princely general
31311 To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace
31312 That he will give you audience and wherein
31313 It shall appear that your demands are just
31314 You shall enjoy them everything set off
31315 That might so much as think you enemies
31316 MOWBRAY But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer
31317 And it proceeds from policy not love
31318 WESTMORELAND Mowbray you overween to take it so
31319 This offer comes from mercy not from fear
31320 For lo within a ken our army lies
31321 Upon mine honour all too confident
31322 To give admittance to a thought of fear
31323 Our battle is more full of names than yours
31324 Our men more perfect in the use of arms
31325 Our armour all as strong our cause the best
31326 Then reason will our hearts should be as good
31327 Say you not then our offer is compell'd
31328 MOWBRAY Well by my will we shall admit no parley
31329 WESTMORELAND That argues but the shame of your offence
31330 A rotten case abides no handling
31331 HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission
31332 In very ample virtue of his father
31333 To hear and absolutely to determine
31334 Of what conditions we shall stand upon
31335 WESTMORELAND That is intended in the general's name
31336 I muse you make so slight a question
31337 ARCHBISHOP Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule
31338 For this contains our general grievances
31339 Each several article herein redress'd
31340 All members of our cause both here and hence
31341 That are insinewed to this action
31342 Acquitted by a true substantial form
31343 And present execution of our wills
31344 To us and to our purposes confin'd
31345 We come within our awful banks again
31346 And knit our powers to the arm of peace
31347 WESTMORELAND This will I show the general Please you lords
31348 In sight of both our battles we may meet
31349 And either end in peace which God so frame
31350 Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords
31351 Which must decide it
31352 ARCHBISHOP My lord we will do so Exit WESTMORELAND
31353 MOWBRAY There is a thing within my bosom tells me
31354 That no conditions of our peace can stand
31355 HASTINGS Fear you not that if we can make our peace
31356 Upon such large terms and so absolute
31357 As our conditions shall consist upon
31358 Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
31359 MOWBRAY Yea but our valuation shall be such
31360 That every slight and falsederived cause
31361 Yea every idle nice and wanton reason
31362 Shall to the King taste of this action
31363 That were our royal faiths martyrs in love
31364 We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
31365 That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
31366 And good from bad find no partition
31367 ARCHBISHOP No no my lord Note this the King is weary
31368 Of dainty and such picking grievances
31369 For he hath found to end one doubt by death
31370 Revives two greater in the heirs of life
31371 And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
31372 And keep no telltale to his memory
31373 That may repeat and history his los
31374 To new remembrance For full well he knows
31375 He cannot so precisely weed this land
31376 As his misdoubts present occasion
31377 His foes are so enrooted with his friends
31378 That plucking to unfix an enemy
31379 He doth unfasten so and shake a friend
31380 So that this land like an offensive wife
31381 That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes
31382 As he is striking holds his infant up
31383 And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
31384 That was uprear'd to execution
31385 HASTINGS Besides the King hath wasted all his rods
31386 On late offenders that he now doth lack
31387 The very instruments of chastisement
31388 So that his power like to a fangless lion
31389 May offer but not hold
31390 ARCHBISHOP 'Tis very true
31391 And therefore be assur'd my good Lord Marshal
31392 If we do now make our atonement well
31393 Our peace will like a broken limb united
31394 Grow stronger for the breaking
31395 MOWBRAY Be it so

31408 PRINCE JOHN You are well encount'red here my cousin Mowbray
31409 Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop
31410 And so to you Lord Hastings and to all
31411 My Lord of York it better show'd with you
31412 When that your flock assembled by the bell
31413 Encircled you to hear with reverence
31414 Your exposition on the holy text
31415 Than now to see you here an iron man
31416 Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
31417 Turning the word to sword and life to death
31418 That man that sits within a monarch's heart
31419 And ripens in the sunshine of his favour
31420 Would he abuse the countenance of the king
31421 Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach
31422 In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop
31423 It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken
31424 How deep you were within the books of God
31425 To us the speaker in His parliament
31426 To us th imagin'd voice of God himself
31427 The very opener and intelligencer
31428 Between the grace the sanctities of heaven
31429 And our dull workings O who shall believe
31430 But you misuse the reverence of your place
31431 Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n
31432 As a false favourite doth his prince's name
31433 In deeds dishonourable You have ta'en up
31434 Under the counterfeited zeal of God
31435 The subjects of His substitute my father
31436 And both against the peace of heaven and him
31437 Have here upswarm'd them
31438 ARCHBISHOP Good my Lord of Lancaster
31439 I am not here against your father's peace
31440 But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland
31441 The time misord'red doth in common sense
31442 Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
31443 To hold our safety up I sent your Grace
31444 The parcels and particulars of our grief
31445 The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court
31446 Whereon this hydra son of war is born
31447 Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
31448 With grant of our most just and right desires
31449 And true obedience of this madness cur'd
31450 Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
31451 MOWBRAY If not we ready are to try our fortunes
31452 To the last man
31453 HASTINGS And though we here fall down
31454 We have supplies to second our attempt
31455 If they miscarry theirs shall second them
31456 And so success of mischief shall be born
31457 And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
31458 Whiles England shall have generation
31459 PRINCE JOHN YOU are too shallow Hastings much to shallow
31460 To sound the bottom of the aftertimes
31461 WESTMORELAND Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
31462 How far forth you do like their articles
31463 PRINCE JOHN I like them all and do allow them well
31464 And swear here by the honour of my blood
31465 My father's purposes have been mistook
31466 And some about him have too lavishly
31467 Wrested his meaning and authority
31468 My lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd
31469 Upon my soul they shall If this may please you
31470 Discharge your powers unto their several counties
31471 As we will ours and here between the armies
31472 Let's drink together friendly and embrace
31473 That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
31474 Of our restored love and amity
31475 ARCHBISHOP I take your princely word for these redresses
31476 PRINCE JOHN I give it you and will maintain my word

31488 WESTMORELAND I am glad of it
31489 Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray
31490 MOWBRAY You wish me health in very happy season
31491 For I am on the sudden something ill
31492 ARCHBISHOP Against ill chances men are ever merry
31493 But heaviness foreruns the good event
31494 WESTMORELAND Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
31495 Serves to say thus 'Some good thing comes tomorrow'
31496 ARCHBISHOP Believe me I am passing light in spirit
31497 MOWBRAY So much the worse if your own rule be true
31498 [Shouts within]
31499 PRINCE JOHN The word of peace is rend'red Hark how they shout
31500 MOWBRAY This had been cheerful after victory
31501 ARCHBISHOP A peace is of the nature of a conquest
31502 For then both parties nobly are subdu'd
31503 And neither party loser

31532 I promis'd you redress of these same grievances
31533 Whereof you did complain which by mine honour
31534 I will perform with a most Christian care
31535 But for you rebels look to taste the due
31536 Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours

31628 dukedom Good faith this same young soberblooded boy doth not
31629 love me nor a man cannot make him laugh but that's no marvel
31630 he drinks no wine There's never none of these demure boys come
31631 to any proof for thin drink doth so overcool their blood and
31632 making many fishmeals that they fall into a kind of male
31633 greensickness and then when they marry they get wenches They
31634 are generally fools and cowardswhich some of us should be too
31635 but for inflammation A good sherrissack hath a twofold
31636 operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all
31637 the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it
31638 apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
31639 delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue
31640 which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second property of
31641 your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before
31642 cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the
31643 badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it
31644 and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes It
31645 illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the
31646 rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital
31647 commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their
31648 captain the heart who great and puff'd up with this retinue
31649 doth any deed of courage and this valour comes of sherris So
31650 that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets
31651 it awork and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil
31652 till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes
31653 it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did
31654 naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and
31655 bare land manured husbanded and till'd with excellent
31656 endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris
31657 that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand sons
31658 the first humane principle I would teach them should be to
31659 forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack
31660 Enter BARDOLPH

31674 And draw no swords but what are sanctified
31675 Our navy is address'd our power connected
31676 Our substitutes in absence well invested
31677 And everything lies level to our wish
31678 Only we want a little personal strength
31679 And pause us till these rebels now afoot

31681 WARWICK Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
31682 Shall soon enjoy

31688 KING Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him
31689 PRINCE HUMPHREY No my good lord he is in presence here
31690 CLARENCE What would my lord and father
31691 KING Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence
31692 How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother
31693 He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas
31694 Thou hast a better place in his affection
31695 Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
31696 And noble offices thou mayst effect
31697 Of mediation after I am dead
31698 Between his greatness and thy other brethren
31699 Therefore omit him not blunt not his love
31700 Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
31701 By seeming cold or careless of his will
31702 For he is gracious if he be observ'd
31703 He hath a tear for pity and a hand
31704 Open as day for melting charity
31705 Yet notwithstanding being incens'd he is flint
31706 As humorous as winter and as sudden
31707 As flaws congealed in the spring of day
31708 His temper therefore must be well observ'd
31709 Chide him for faults and do it reverently
31710 When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth
31711 But being moody give him line and scope
31712 Till that his passions like a whale on ground
31713 Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas
31714 And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
31715 A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
31716 That the united vessel of their blood
31717 Mingled with venom of suggestion
31718 As force perforce the age will pour it in
31719 Shall never leak though it do work as strong

31721 CLARENCE I shall observe him with all care and love
31722 KING Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas
31723 CLARENCE He is not there today he dines in London
31724 KING And how accompanied Canst thou tell that
31725 CLARENCE With Poins and other his continual followers
31726 KING Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
31727 And he the noble image of my youth
31728 Is overspread with them therefore my grief
31729 Stretches itself beyond the hour of death
31730 The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
31731 In forms imaginary th'unguided days
31732 And rotten times that you shall look upon
31733 When I am sleeping with my ancestors
31734 For when his headstrong riot hath no curb
31735 When rage and hot blood are his counsellors
31736 When means and lavish manners meet together
31737 O with what wings shall his affections fly
31738 Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay
31739 WARWICK My gracious lord you look beyond him quite
31740 The Prince but studies his companions
31741 Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
31742 'Tis needful that the most immodest word
31743 Be look'd upon and learnt which once attain'd
31744 Your Highness knows comes to no further use
31745 But to be known and hated So like gross terms
31746 The Prince will in the perfectness of time
31747 Cast off his followers and their memory
31748 Shall as a pattern or a measure live
31749 By which his Grace must mete the lives of other
31750 Turning past evils to advantages

31780 But write her fair words still in foulest letters
31781 She either gives a stomach and no food
31782 Such are the poor in health or else a feast
31783 And takes away the stomach such are the rich
31784 That have abundance and enjoy it not

31794 CLARENCE No no he cannot long hold out these pangs
31795 Th incessant care and labour of his mind
31796 Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in

31798 PRINCE HUMPHREY The people fear me for they do observe
31799 Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature
31800 The seasons change their manners as the year
31801 Had found some months asleep and leapt them over
31802 CLARENCE The river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between

31848 Did he suspire that light and weightless down
31849 Perforce must move My gracious lord my father
31850 This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
31851 That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd
31852 So many English kings Thy due from me
31853 Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
31854 Which nature love and filial tenderness
31855 Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously
31856 My due from thee is this imperial crown
31857 Which as immediate from thy place and blood
31858 Derives itself to me [Putting on the crown] Lo where it sits
31859 Which God shall guard and put the world's whole strength
31860 Into one giant arm it shall not force
31861 This lineal honour from me This from thee
31862 Will I to mine leave as 'tis left to me Exit

31877 Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
31878 My sleep my death
31879 Find him my lord of Warwick chide him hither
31880 Exit WARWICK
31881 This part of his conjoins with my disease
31882 And helps to end me See sons what things you are
31883 How quickly nature falls into revolt
31884 When gold becomes her object
31885 For this the foolish overcareful fathers
31886 Have broke their sleep with thoughts
31887 Their brains with care their bones with industry
31888 For this they have engrossed and pil'd up
31889 The cank'red heaps of strangeachieved gold
31890 For this they have been thoughtful to invest
31891 Their sons with arts and martial exercises
31892 When like the bee tolling from every flower
31893 The virtuous sweets
31894 Our thighs with wax our mouths with honey pack'd
31895 We bring it to the hive and like the bees
31896 Are murd'red for our pains This bitter taste
31897 Yields his engrossments to the ending father
31898 Reenter WARWICK
31899 Now where is he that will not stay so long
31900 Till his friend sickness hath determin'd me
31901 WARWICK My lord I found the Prince in the next room
31902 Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
31903 With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow
31904 That tyranny which never quaff'd but blood
31905 Would by beholding him have wash'd his knife
31906 With gentle eyedrops He is coming hither
31907 KING But wherefore did he take away the crown
31908 Reenter PRINCE HENRY
31909 Lo where he comes Come hither to me Harry
31910 Depart the chamber leave us here alone
31911 Exeunt all but the KING and the PRINCE
31912 PRINCE I never thought to hear you speak again
31913 KING Thy wish was father Harry to that thought
31914 I stay too long by thee I weary thee
31915 Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
31916 That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
31917 Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth
31918 Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee
31919 Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
31920 Is held from falling with so weak a wind
31921 That it will quickly drop my day is dim
31922 Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours
31923 Were thine without offense and at my death
31924 Thou hast seal'd up my expectation
31925 Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not
31926 And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it
31927 Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts
31928 Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
31929 To stab at half an hour of my life
31930 What canst thou not forbear me half an hour
31931 Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
31932 And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
31933 That thou art crowned not that I am dead
31934 Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
31935 Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
31936 Only compound me with forgotten dust
31937 Give that which gave thee life unto the worms
31938 Pluck down my officers break my decrees
31939 For now a time is come to mock at form
31940 Harry the Fifth is crown'd Up vanity
31941 Down royal state All you sage counsellors hence
31942 And to the English court assemble now
31943 From every region apes of idleness
31944 Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
31945 Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
31946 Revel the night rob murder and commit
31947 The oldest sins the newest kind of ways
31948 Be happy he will trouble you no more
31949 England shall double gild his treble guilt
31950 England shall give him office honour might
31951 For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks
31952 The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
31953 Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
31954 O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
31955 When that my care could not withhold thy riots
31956 What wilt thou do when riot is thy care
31957 O thou wilt be a wilderness again
31958 Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
31959 PRINCE O pardon me my liege But for my tears
31960 The moist impediments unto my speech
31961 I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
31962 Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
31963 The course of it so far There is your crown
31964 And he that wears the crown immortally
31965 Long guard it yours [Kneeling] If I affect it more
31966 Than as your honour and as your renown
31967 Let me no more from this obedience rise
31968 Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
31969 Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
31970 God witness with me when I here came in
31971 And found no course of breath within your Majesty
31972 How cold it struck my heart If I do feign
31973 O let me in my present wildness die
31974 And never live to show th incredulous world
31975 The noble change that I have purposed
31976 Coming to look on you thinking you dead
31977 And dead almost my liege to think you were
31978 I spake unto this crown as having sense
31979 And thus upbraided it 'The care on thee depending
31980 Hath fed upon the body of my father
31981 Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
31982 Other less fine in carat is more precious
31983 Preserving life in med'cine potable
31984 But thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd
31985 Hast eat thy bearer up Thus my most royal liege
31986 Accusing it I put it on my head
31987 To try with it as with an enemy
31988 That had before my face murd'red my father
31989 The quarrel of a true inheritor
31990 But if it did infect my blood with joy
31991 Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
31992 If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
31993 Did with the least affection of a welcome
31994 Give entertainment to the might of it
31995 Let God for ever keep it from my head
31996 And make me as the poorest vassal is
31997 That doth with awe and terror kneel to it
31998 KING O my son
31999 God put it in thy mind to take it hence
32000 That thou mightst win the more thy father's love
32001 Pleading so wisely in excuse of it
32002 Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed
32003 And hear I think the very latest counsel
32004 That ever I shall breathe God knows my son
32005 By what bypaths and indirect crook'd ways
32006 I met this crown and I myself know well
32007 How troublesome it sat upon my head
32008 To thee it shall descend with better quiet
32009 Better opinion better confirmation
32010 For all the soil of the achievement goes
32011 With me into the earth It seem'd in me
32012 But as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand
32013 And I had many living to upbraid
32014 My gain of it by their assistances
32015 Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
32016 Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears
32017 Thou seest with peril I have answered
32018 For all my reign hath been but as a scene
32019 Acting that argument And now my death
32020 Changes the mood for what in me was purchas'd
32021 Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
32022 So thou the garland wear'st successively
32023 Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do
32024 Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
32025 And all my friends which thou must make thy friends
32026 Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out
32027 By whose fell working I was first advanc'd
32028 And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
32029 To be again displac'd which to avoid
32030 I cut them off and had a purpose now
32031 To lead out many to the Holy Land
32032 Lest rest and lying still might make them look
32033 Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry
32034 Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
32035 With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
32036 May waste the memory of the former days
32037 More would I but my lungs are wasted so
32038 That strength of speech is utterly denied me
32039 How I came by the crown O God forgive
32040 And grant it may with thee in true peace live
32041 PRINCE My gracious liege
32042 You won it wore it kept it gave it me
32043 Then plain and right must my possession be
32044 Which I with more than with a common pain
32045 'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain
32046 Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER WARWICK LORDS and others
32047 KING Look look here comes my John of Lancaster
32048 PRINCE JOHN Health peace and happiness to my royal father
32049 KING Thou bring'st me happiness and peace son John
32050 But health alack with youthful wings is flown
32051 From this bare wither'd trunk Upon thy sight
32052 My worldly business makes a period
32053 Where is my Lord of Warwick
32054 PRINCE My Lord of Warwick
32055 KING Doth any name particular belong
32056 Unto the lodging where I first did swoon
32057 WARWICK 'Tis call'd Jerusalem my noble lord
32058 KING Laud be to God Even there my life must end
32059 It hath been prophesied to me many years
32060 I should not die but in Jerusalem
32061 Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land
32062 But bear me to that chamber there I'll lie
32063 In that Jerusalem shall Harry die Exeunt

32127 and PAGE] If I were sawed into quantities I should make four
32128 dozen of such bearded hermits staves as Master Shallow It is a
32129 wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's
32130 spirits and his They by observing of him do bear themselves
32131 like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned
32132 into a justicelike servingman Their spirits are so married in
32133 conjunction with the participation of society that they flock
32134 together in consent like so many wild geese If I had a suit to
32135 Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of
32136 being near their master if to his men I would curry with Master
32137 Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is
32138 certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught
32139 as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed
32140 of their company I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow
32141 to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six
32142 fashions which is four terms or two actions and 'a shall laugh
32143 without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight
32144 oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
32145 had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till
32146 his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up

32158 And to our purposes he lives no more
32159 CHIEF JUSTICE I would his Majesty had call'd me with him
32160 The service that I truly did his life
32161 Hath left me open to all injuries
32162 WARWICK Indeed I think the young king loves you not
32163 CHIEF JUSTICE I know he doth not and do arm myself
32164 To welcome the condition of the time

32176 GLOUCESTER & CLARENCE Good morrow cousin
32177 PRINCE JOHN We meet like men that had forgot to speak

32181 CHIEF JUSTICE Peace be with us lest we be heavier
32182 PRINCE HUMPHREY O good my lord you have lost a friend indeed

32201 Sits not so easy on me as you think
32202 Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
32203 This is the English not the Turkish court
32204 Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds
32205 But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers
32206 For by my faith it very well becomes you
32207 Sorrow so royally in you appears
32208 That I will deeply put the fashion on
32209 And wear it in my heart Why then be sad
32210 But entertain no more of it good brothers
32211 Than a joint burden laid upon us all
32212 For me by heaven I bid you be assur'd
32213 I'll be your father and your brother too
32214 Let me but bear your love I'll bear your cares
32215 Yet weep that Harry's dead and so will I
32216 But Harry lives that shall convert those tears
32217 By number into hours of happiness
32218 BROTHERS We hope no otherwise from your Majesty
32219 KING You all look strangely on me and you most
32220 You are I think assur'd I love you not
32221 CHIEF JUSTICE I am assur'd if I be measur'd rightly
32222 Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me
32223 KING No
32224 How might a prince of my great hopes forget
32225 So great indignities you laid upon me
32226 What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
32227 Th immediate heir of England Was this easy
32228 May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgotten
32229 CHIEF JUSTICE I then did use the person of your father
32230 The image of his power lay then in me
32231 And in th administration of his law
32232 Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth
32233 Your Highness pleased to forget my place
32234 The majesty and power of law and justice
32235 The image of the King whom I presented
32236 And struck me in my very seat of judgment
32237 Whereon as an offender to your father
32238 I gave bold way to my authority
32239 And did commit you If the deed were ill
32240 Be you contented wearing now the garland
32241 To have a son set your decrees at nought
32242 To pluck down justice from your awful bench
32243 To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
32244 That guards the peace and safety of your person
32245 Nay more to spurn at your most royal image
32246 And mock your workings in a second body
32247 Question your royal thoughts make the case yours
32248 Be now the father and propose a son
32249 Hear your own dignity so much profan'd
32250 See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
32251 Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd
32252 And then imagine me taking your part
32253 And in your power soft silencing your son
32254 After this cold considerance sentence me
32255 And as you are a king speak in your state
32256 What I have done that misbecame my place
32257 My person or my liege's sovereignty
32258 KING You are right Justice and you weigh this well
32259 Therefore still bear the balance and the sword
32260 And I do wish your honours may increase
32261 Till you do live to see a son of mine
32262 Offend you and obey you as I did
32263 So shall I live to speak my father's words
32264 'Happy am I that have a man so bold
32265 That dares do justice on my proper son
32266 And not less happy having such a son
32267 That would deliver up his greatness so
32268 Into the hands of justice You did commit me
32269 For which I do commit into your hand
32270 Th unstained sword that you have us'd to bear
32271 With this remembrance that you use the same
32272 With the like bold just and impartial spirit
32273 As you have done 'gainst me There is my hand
32274 You shall be as a father to my youth
32275 My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
32276 And I will stoop and humble my intents
32277 To your wellpractis'd wise directions
32278 And Princes all believe me I beseech you
32279 My father is gone wild into his grave
32280 For in his tomb lie my affections
32281 And with his spirits sadly I survive
32282 To mock the expectation of the world
32283 To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
32284 Rotten opinion who hath writ me down
32285 After my seeming The tide of blood in me
32286 Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now
32287 Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
32288 Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
32289 And flow henceforth in formal majesty
32290 Now call we our high court of parliament
32291 And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
32292 That the great body of our state may go
32293 In equal rank with the best govern'd nation
32294 That war or peace or both at once may be
32295 As things acquainted and familiar to us
32296 In which you father shall have foremost hand
32297 Our coronation done we will accite
32298 As I before rememb'red all our state
32299 And God consigning to my good intents

32589 First my fear then my curtsy last my speech My fear is your

32591 If you look for a good speech now you undo me for what I have to say
32592 is of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt
32593 prove mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the venture
32594 Be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end
32595 of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you
32596 a better I meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
32597 ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle
32598 creditors lose Here I promis'd you I would be and here I commit
32599 my body to your mercies Bate me some and I will pay you some and
32600 as most debtors do promise you infinitely and so I kneel down before
32601 you but indeed to pray for the Queen
32602 If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to
32603 use my legs And yet that were but light paymentto dance out of
32604 your debt But a good conscience will make any possible
32605 satisfaction and so would I All the gentlewomen here have forgiven
32606 me If the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with
32607 the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly
32608 One word more I beseech you If you be not too much cloy'd with fat
32609 meat our humble author will continue the story with Sir John in
32610 it and make you merry with fair Katherine of France where for
32611 anything I know Falstaff shall die of a sweat unless already 'a be
32612 killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and this
32613 is not the man My tongue is weary when my legs are too I will bid
32614 you good night

32715 ACT I SCENE I
32716 London An antechamber in the KING'S palace
32717 Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY
32718 CANTERBURY My lord I'll tell you that self bill is urg'd
32719 Which in th eleventh year of the last king's reign
32720 Was like and had indeed against us pass'd
32721 But that the scambling and unquiet time
32722 Did push it out of farther question
32723 ELY But how my lord shall we resist it now
32724 CANTERBURY It must be thought on If it pass against us
32725 We lose the better half of our possession
32726 For all the temporal lands which men devout
32727 By testament have given to the church
32728 Would they strip from us being valu'd thus
32729 As much as would maintain to the King's honour
32730 Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
32731 Six thousand and two hundred good esquires
32732 And to relief of lazars and weak age
32733 Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
32734 A hundred almshouses right well supplied
32735 And to the coffers of the King beside
32736 A thousand pounds by th year thus runs the bill
32737 ELY This would drink deep
32738 CANTERBURY 'T would drink the cup and all
32739 ELY But what prevention
32740 CANTERBURY The King is full of grace and fair regard
32741 ELY And a true lover of the holy Church
32742 CANTERBURY The courses of his youth promis'd it not
32743 The breath no sooner left his father's body
32744 But that his wildness mortified in him
32745 Seem'd to die too yea at that very moment
32746 Consideration like an angel came
32747 And whipp'd th offending Adam out of him
32748 Leaving his body as a paradise
32749 T'envelop and contain celestial spirits
32750 Never was such a sudden scholar made
32751 Never came reformation in a flood
32752 With such a heady currance scouring faults
32753 Nor never Hydraheaded wilfulnes
32754 So soon did lose his seat and all at once
32755 As in this king
32756 ELY We are blessed in the change
32757 CANTERBURY Hear him but reason in divinity
32758 And alladmiring with an inward wish
32759 You would desire the King were made a prelate
32760 Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
32761 You would say it hath been all in all his study
32762 List his discourse of war and you shall hear
32763 A fearful battle rend'red you in music
32764 Turn him to any cause of policy
32765 The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
32766 Familiar as his garter that when he speaks
32767 The air a charter'd libertine is still
32768 And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
32769 To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences
32770 So that the art and practic part of life
32771 Must be the mistress to this theoric
32772 Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it
32773 Since his addiction was to courses vain
32774 His companies unletter'd rude and shallow
32775 His hours fill'd up with riots banquets sports
32776 And never noted in him any study
32777 Any retirement any sequestration
32778 From open haunts and popularity
32779 ELY The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
32780 And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
32781 Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality
32782 And so the Prince obscur'd his contemplation
32783 Under the veil of wildness which no doubt
32784 Grew like the summer grass fastest by night
32785 Unseen yet crescive in his faculty
32786 CANTERBURY It must be so for miracles are ceas'd
32787 And therefore we must needs admit the means
32788 How things are perfected
32789 ELY But my good lord
32790 How now for mitigation of this bill
32791 Urg'd by the Commons Doth his Majesty
32792 Incline to it or no
32793 CANTERBURY He seems indifferent
32794 Or rather swaying more upon our part
32795 Than cherishing th exhibiters against us
32796 For I have made an offer to his Majesty
32797 Upon our spiritual convocation
32798 And in regard of causes now in hand
32799 Which I have open'd to his Grace at large
32800 As touching France to give a greater sum
32801 Than ever at one time the clergy yet
32802 Did to his predecessors part withal
32803 ELY How did this offer seem receiv'd my lord
32804 CANTERBURY With good acceptance of his Majesty
32805 Save that there was not time enough to hear
32806 As I perceiv'd his Grace would fain have done
32807 The severals and unhidden passages
32808 Of his true tides to some certain dukedoms
32809 And generally to the crown and seat of France
32810 Deriv'd from Edward his greatgrandfather
32811 ELY What was th impediment that broke this off
32812 CANTERBURY The French ambassador upon that instant
32813 Crav'd audience and the hour I think is come
32814 To give him hearing is it four o'clock
32815 ELY It is
32816 CANTERBURY Then go we in to know his embassy
32817 Which I could with a ready guess declare
32818 Before the Frenchman speak a word of it
32819 ELY I'll wait upon you and I long to hear it Exeunt
32820 SCENE II
32821 London The Presence Chamber in the KING'S palace
32822 Enter the KING GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER WARWICK WESTMORELAND
32823 and attendants
32824 KING HENRY Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury
32825 EXETER Not here in presence
32826 KING HENRY Send for him good uncle
32827 WESTMORELAND Shall we call in th ambassador my liege
32828 KING HENRY Not yet my cousin we would be resolv'd
32829 Before we hear him of some things of weight
32830 That task our thoughts concerning us and France
32831 Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and
32832 the BISHOP OF ELY
32833 CANTERBURY God and his angels guard your sacred throne
32834 And make you long become it
32835 KING HENRY Sure we thank you
32836 My learned lord we pray you to proceed
32837 And justly and religiously unfold
32838 Why the law Salique that they have in France
32839 Or should or should not bar us in our claim
32840 And God forbid my dear and faithful lord
32841 That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
32842 Or nicely charge your understanding soul
32843 With opening titles miscreate whose right
32844 Suits not in native colours with the truth
32845 For God doth know how many now in health
32846 Shall drop their blood in approbation
32847 Of what your reverence shall incite us to
32848 Therefore take heed how you impawn our person
32849 How you awake our sleeping sword of war
32850 We charge you in the name of God take heed
32851 For never two such kingdoms did contend
32852 Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
32853 Are every one a woe a sore complaint
32854 'Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
32855 That makes such waste in brief mortality
32856 Under this conjuration speak my lord
32857 For we will hear note and believe in heart
32858 That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
32859 As pure as sin with baptism
32860 CANTERBURY Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
32861 That owe yourselves your lives and services
32862 To this imperial throne There is no bar
32863 To make against your Highness claim to France
32864 But this which they produce from Pharamond
32865 'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant'
32866 'No woman shall succeed in Salique land'
32867 Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
32868 To be the realm of France and Pharamond
32869 The founder of this law and female bar
32870 Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
32871 That the land Salique is in Germany
32872 Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe
32873 Where Charles the Great having subdu'd the Saxons
32874 There left behind and settled certain French
32875 Who holding in disdain the German women
32876 For some dishonest manners of their life
32877 Establish'd then this law to wit no female
32878 Should be inheritrix in Salique land
32879 Which Salique as I said 'twixt Elbe and Sala
32880 Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen
32881 Then doth it well appear the Salique law
32882 Was not devised for the realm of France
32883 Nor did the French possess the Salique land
32884 Until four hundred one and twenty years
32885 After defunction of King Pharamond
32886 Idly suppos'd the founder of this law
32887 Who died within the year of our redemption
32888 Four hundred twentysix and Charles the Great
32889 Subdu'd the Saxons and did seat the French
32890 Beyond the river Sala in the year
32891 Eight hundred five Besides their writers say
32892 King Pepin which deposed Childeric
32893 Did as heir general being descended
32894 Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair
32895 Make claim and title to the crown of France
32896 Hugh Capet also who usurp'd the crown
32897 Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male
32898 Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great
32899 To find his title with some shows of truth
32900 Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
32901 Convey'd himself as th heir to th Lady Lingare
32902 Daughter to Charlemain who was the son
32903 To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son
32904 Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth
32905 Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet
32906 Could not keep quiet in his conscience
32907 Wearing the crown of France till satisfied
32908 That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother
32909 Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare
32910 Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine
32911 By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
32912 Was reunited to the Crown of France
32913 So that as clear as is the summer's sun
32914 King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim
32915 King Lewis his satisfaction all appear
32916 To hold in right and tide of the female
32917 So do the kings of France unto this day
32918 Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
32919 To bar your Highness claiming from the female
32920 And rather choose to hide them in a net
32921 Than amply to imbar their crooked tides
32922 Usurp'd from you and your progenitors
32923 KING HENRY May I with right and conscience make this claim
32924 CANTERBURY The sin upon my head dread sovereign
32925 For in the book of Numbers is it writ
32926 When the man dies let the inheritance
32927 Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord
32928 Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
32929 Look back into your mighty ancestors
32930 Go my dread lord to your greatgrandsire's tomb
32931 From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
32932 And your greatuncle's Edward the Black Prince
32933 Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy
32934 Making defeat on the fun power of France
32935 Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
32936 Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
32937 Forage in blood of French nobility
32938 O noble English that could entertain
32939 With half their forces the full pride of France
32940 And let another half stand laughing by
32941 All out of work and cold for action
32942 ELY Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
32943 And with your puissant arm renew their feats
32944 You are their heir you sit upon their throne
32945 The blood and courage that renowned them
32946 Runs in your veins and my thricepuissant liege
32947 Is in the very Maymorn of his youth
32948 Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
32949 EXETER Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
32950 Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
32951 As did the former lions of your blood
32952 WESTMORELAND They know your Grace hath cause and means and might
32953 So hath your Highness never King of England
32954 Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
32955 Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
32956 And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France
32957 CANTERBURY O let their bodies follow my dear liege
32958 With blood and sword and fire to win your right
32959 In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
32960 Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
32961 As never did the clergy at one time
32962 Bring in to any of your ancestors
32963 KING HENRY We must not only arm t invade the French
32964 But lay down our proportions to defend
32965 Against the Scot who will make road upon us
32966 With all advantages
32967 CANTERBURY They of those marches gracious sovereign
32968 Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
32969 Our inland from the pilfering borderers
32970 KING HENRY We do not mean the coursing snatchers only
32971 But fear the main intendment of the Scot
32972 Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
32973 For you shall read that my greatgrandfather
32974 Never went with his forces into France
32975 But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
32976 Came pouring like the tide into a breach
32977 With ample and brim fulness of his force
32978 Galling the gleaned land with hot assays
32979 Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns
32980 That England being empty of defence
32981 Hath shook and trembled at th ill neighbourhood
32982 CANTERBURY She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege
32983 For hear her but exampled by herself
32984 When all her chivalry hath been in France
32985 And she a mourning widow of her nobles
32986 She hath herself not only well defended
32987 But taken and impounded as a stray
32988 The King of Scots whom she did send to France
32989 To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
32990 And make her chronicle as rich with praise
32991 As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
32992 With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries
32993 WESTMORELAND But there's a saying very old and true
32994 'If that you will France win
32995 Then with Scotland first begin'
32996 For once the eagle England being in prey
32997 To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
32998 Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
32999 Playing the mouse in absence of the cat
33000 To tear and havoc more than she can eat
33001 EXETER It follows then the cat must stay at home
33002 Yet that is but a crush'd necessity
33003 Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
33004 And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
33005 While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
33006 Th advised head defends itself at home
33007 For government though high and low and lower
33008 Put into parts doth keep in one consent
33009 Congreeing in a full and natural close
33010 Like music
33011 CANTERBURY Therefore doth heaven divide
33012 The state of man in divers functions
33013 Setting endeavour in continual motion
33014 To which is fixed as an aim or but
33015 Obedience for so work the honey bees
33016 Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
33017 The act of order to a peopled kingdom
33018 They have a king and officers of sorts
33019 Where some like magistrates correct at home
33020 Others like merchants venture trade abroad
33021 Others like soldiers armed in their stings
33022 Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds
33023 Which pillage they with merry march bring home
33024 To the tentroyal of their emperor
33025 Who busied in his majesty surveys
33026 The singing masons building roofs of gold
33027 The civil citizens kneading up the honey
33028 The poor mechanic porters crowding in
33029 Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
33030 The sadey'd justice with his surly hum
33031 Delivering o'er to executors pale
33032 The lazy yawning drone I this infer
33033 That many things having full reference
33034 To one consent may work contrariously
33035 As many arrows loosed several ways
33036 Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
33037 As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
33038 As many lines close in the dial's centre
33039 So many a thousand actions once afoot
33040 End in one purpose and be all well home
33041 Without defeat Therefore to France my liege
33042 Divide your happy England into four
33043 Whereof take you one quarter into France
33044 And you withal shall make all Gallia shake
33045 If we with thrice such powers left at home
33046 Cannot defend our own doors from the dog
33047 Let us be worried and our nation lose
33048 The name of hardiness and policy
33049 KING HENRY Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
33050 Exeunt some attendants
33051 Now are we well resolv'd and by God's help
33052 And yours the noble sinews of our power
33053 France being ours we'll bend it to our awe
33054 Or break it all to pieces or there we'll sit
33055 Ruling in large and ample empery
33056 O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms
33057 Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
33058 Tombless with no remembrance over them
33059 Either our history shall with full mouth
33060 Speak freely of our acts or else our grave
33061 Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
33062 Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph
33063 Enter AMBASSADORS of France
33064 Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
33065 Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear
33066 Your greeting is from him not from the King
33067 AMBASSADOR May't please your Majesty to give us leave
33068 Freely to render what we have in charge
33069 Or shall we sparingly show you far of
33070 The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy
33071 KING HENRY We are no tyrant but a Christian king
33072 Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
33073 As are our wretches fett'red in our prisons
33074 Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
33075 Tell us the Dauphin's mind
33076 AMBASSADOR Thus then in few
33077 Your Highness lately sending into France
33078 Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
33079 Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third
33080 In answer of which claim the Prince our master
33081 Says that you savour too much of your youth
33082 And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France
33083 That can be with a nimble galliard won
33084 You cannot revel into dukedoms there
33085 He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
33086 This tun of treasure and in lieu of this
33087 Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
33088 Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
33089 KING HENRY What treasure uncle
33090 EXETER Tennisballs my liege
33091 KING HENRY We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
33092 His present and your pains we thank you for
33093 When we have match'd our rackets to these balls
33094 We will in France by God's grace play a set
33095 Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard
33096 Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
33097 That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
33098 With chaces And we understand him well
33099 How he comes o'er us with our wilder days
33100 Not measuring what use we made of them
33101 We never valu'd this poor seat of England
33102 And therefore living hence did give ourself
33103 To barbarous licence as 'tis ever common
33104 That men are merriest when they are from home
33105 But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
33106 Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
33107 When I do rouse me in my throne of France
33108 For that I have laid by my majesty
33109 And plodded like a man for workingdays
33110 But I will rise there with so full a glory
33111 That I will dazzle all the eyes of France
33112 Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us
33113 And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his
33114 Hath turn'd his balls to gunstones and his soul
33115 Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
33116 That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
33117 Shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands
33118 Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
33119 And some are yet ungotten and unborn
33120 That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn
33121 But this lies all within the will of God
33122 To whom I do appeal and in whose name
33123 Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
33124 To venge me as I may and to put forth
33125 My rightful hand in a wellhallow'd cause
33126 So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin
33127 His jest will savour but of shallow wit
33128 When thousands weep more than did laugh at it
33129 Convey them with safe conduct Fare you well
33130 Exeunt AMBASSADORS
33131 EXETER This was a merry message
33132 KING HENRY We hope to make the sender blush at it
33133 Therefore my lords omit no happy hour
33134 That may give furth'rance to our expedition
33135 For we have now no thought in us but France
33136 Save those to God that run before our business
33137 Therefore let our proportions for these wars
33138 Be soon collected and all things thought upon
33139 That may with reasonable swiftness ad
33140 More feathers to our wings for God before
33141 We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door
33142 Therefore let every man now task his thought
33143 That this fair action may on foot be brought Exeunt

33153 Flourish Enter CHORUS
33154 CHORUS Now all the youth of England are on fire
33155 And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
33156 Now thrive the armourers and honour's thought
33157 Reigns solely in the breast of every man
33158 They sell the pasture now to buy the horse
33159 Following the mirror of all Christian kings
33160 With winged heels as English Mercuries
33161 For now sits Expectation in the air
33162 And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
33163 With crowns imperial crowns and coronets
33164 Promis'd to Harry and his followers
33165 The French advis'd by good intelligence
33166 Of this most dreadful preparation
33167 Shake in their fear and with pale policy
33168 Seek to divert the English purposes
33169 O England model to thy inward greatness
33170 Like little body with a mighty heart
33171 What mightst thou do that honour would thee do
33172 Were all thy children kind and natural
33173 But see thy fault France hath in thee found out
33174 A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
33175 With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men
33176 One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second
33177 Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third
33178 Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
33179 Have for the gilt of France O guilt indeed
33180 Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France
33181 And by their hands this grace of kings must die
33182 If hell and treason hold their promises
33183 Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton
33184 Linger your patience on and we'll digest
33185 Th abuse of distance force a play
33186 The sum is paid the traitors are agreed
33187 The King is set from London and the scene
33188 Is now transported gentles to Southampton
33189 There is the playhouse now there must you sit
33190 And thence to France shall we convey you safe
33191 And bring you back charming the narrow seas
33192 To give you gentle pass for if we may
33193 We'll not offend one stomach with our play
33194 But till the King come forth and not till then
33195 Unto Southampton do we shift our scene Exit

33322 Southampton A councilchamber
33323 Enter EXETER BEDFORD and WESTMORELAND
33324 BEDFORD Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
33325 EXETER They shall be apprehended by and by
33326 WESTMORELAND How smooth and even they do bear themselves
33327 As if allegiance in their bosoms sat
33328 Crowned with faith and constant loyalty
33329 BEDFORD The King hath note of all that they intend
33330 By interception which they dream not of
33331 EXETER Nay but the man that was his bedfellow
33332 Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours
33333 That he should for a foreign purse so sell
33334 His sovereign's life to death and treachery
33335 Trumpets sound Enter the KING SCROOP
33336 CAMBRIDGE GREY and attendants
33337 KING HENRY Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
33338 My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham
33339 And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
33340 Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us
33341 Will cut their passage through the force of France
33342 Doing the execution and the act
33343 For which we have in head assembled them
33344 SCROOP No doubt my liege if each man do his best
33345 KING HENRY I doubt not that since we are well persuaded
33346 We carry not a heart with us from hence
33347 That grows not in a fair consent with ours
33348 Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
33349 Success and conquest to attend on us
33350 CAMBRIDGE Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd
33351 Than is your Majesty There's not I think a subject
33352 That sits in heartgrief and uneasines
33353 Under the sweet shade of your government
33354 GREY True those that were your father's enemies
33355 Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
33356 With hearts create of duty and of zeal
33357 KING HENRY We therefore have great cause of thankfulness
33358 And shall forget the office of our hand
33359 Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
33360 According to the weight and worthiness
33361 SCROOP So service shall with steeled sinews toil
33362 And labour shall refresh itself with hope
33363 To do your Grace incessant services
33364 KING HENRY We judge no less Uncle of Exeter
33365 Enlarge the man committed yesterday
33366 That rail'd against our person We consider
33367 It was excess of wine that set him on
33368 And on his more advice we pardon him
33369 SCROOP That's mercy but too much security
33370 Let him be punish'd sovereign lest example
33371 Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
33372 KING HENRY O let us yet be merciful
33373 CAMBRIDGE So may your Highness and yet punish too
33374 GREY Sir
33375 You show great mercy if you give him life
33376 After the taste of much correction
33377 KING HENRY Alas your too much love and care of me
33378 Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch
33379 If little faults proceeding on distemper
33380 Shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye
33381 When capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested
33382 Appear before us We'll yet enlarge that man
33383 Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care
33384 And tender preservation of our person
33385 Would have him punish'd And now to our French causes
33386 Who are the late commissioners
33387 CAMBRIDGE I one my lord
33388 Your Highness bade me ask for it today
33389 SCROOP So did you me my liege
33390 GREY And I my royal sovereign
33391 KING HENRY Then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours
33392 There yours Lord Scroop of Masham and Sir Knight
33393 Grey of Northumberland this same is yours
33394 Read them and know I know your worthiness
33395 My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter
33396 We will aboard tonight Why how now gentlemen
33397 What see you in those papers that you lose
33398 So much complexion Look ye how they change
33399 Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there
33400 That have so cowarded and chas'd your blood
33401 Out of appearance
33402 CAMBRIDGE I do confess my fault
33403 And do submit me to your Highness mercy
33404 GREY SCROOP To which we all appeal
33405 KING HENRY The mercy that was quick in us but late
33406 By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd
33407 You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
33408 For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
33409 As dogs upon their masters worrying you
33410 See you my princes and my noble peers
33411 These English monsters My Lord of Cambridge here
33412 You know how apt our love was to accord
33413 To furnish him with an appertinents
33414 Belonging to his honour and this man
33415 Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspir'd
33416 And sworn unto the practices of France
33417 To kill us here in Hampton to the which
33418 This knight no less for bounty bound to us
33419 Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O
33420 What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel
33421 Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
33422 Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
33423 That knew'st the very bottom of my soul
33424 That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold
33425 Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use
33426 May it be possible that foreign hire
33427 Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
33428 That might annoy my finger 'Tis so strange
33429 That though the truth of it stands off as gross
33430 As black and white my eye will scarcely see it
33431 Treason and murder ever kept together
33432 As two yokedevils sworn to either's purpose
33433 Working so grossly in a natural cause
33434 That admiration did not whoop at them
33435 But thou 'gainst all proportion didst bring in
33436 Wonder to wait on treason and on murder
33437 And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
33438 That wrought upon thee so preposterously
33439 Hath got the voice in hell for excellence
33440 And other devils that suggest by treasons
33441 Do botch and bungle up damnation
33442 With patches colours and with forms being fetch'd
33443 From glist'ring semblances of piety
33444 But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
33445 Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
33446 Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
33447 If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
33448 Should with his lion gait walk the whole world
33449 He might return to vasty Tartar back
33450 And tell the legions 'I can never win
33451 A soul so easy as that Englishman's'
33452 O how hast thou with jealousy infected
33453 The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful
33454 Why so didst thou Seem they grave and learned
33455 Why so didst thou Come they of noble family
33456 Why so didst thou Seem they religious
33457 Why so didst thou Or are they spare in diet
33458 Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
33459 Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
33460 Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement
33461 Not working with the eye without the ear
33462 And but in purged judgment trusting neither
33463 Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
33464 And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
33465 To mark the fullfraught man and best indued
33466 With some suspicion I will weep for thee
33467 For this revolt of thine methinks is like
33468 Another fall of man Their faults are open
33469 Arrest them to the answer of the law
33470 And God acquit them of their practices
33471 EXETER I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl
33472 of Cambridge
33473 I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop
33474 of Masham
33475 I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey
33476 knight of Northumberland
33477 SCROOP Our purposes God justly hath discover'd
33478 And I repent my fault more than my death
33479 Which I beseech your Highness to forgive
33480 Although my body pay the price of it
33481 CAMBRIDGE For me the gold of France did not seduce
33482 Although I did admit it as a motive
33483 The sooner to effect what I intended
33484 But God be thanked for prevention
33485 Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice
33486 Beseeching God and you to pardon me
33487 GREY Never did faithful subject more rejoice
33488 At the discovery of most dangerous treason
33489 Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself
33490 Prevented from a damned enterprise
33491 My fault but not my body pardon sovereign
33492 KING HENRY God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence
33493 You have conspir'd against our royal person
33494 Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
33495 Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death
33496 Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
33497 His princes and his peers to servitude
33498 His subjects to oppression and contempt
33499 And his whole kingdom into desolation
33500 Touching our person seek we no revenge
33501 But we our kingdom's safety must so tender
33502 Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
33503 We do deliver you Get you therefore hence
33504 Poor miserable wretches to your death
33505 The taste whereof God of his mercy give
33506 You patience to endure and true repentance
33507 Of all your dear offences Bear them hence
33508 Exeunt CAMBRIDGE SCROOP and GREY guarded
33509 Now lords for France the enterprise whereof
33510 Shall be to you as us like glorious
33511 We doubt not of a fair and lucky war
33512 Since God so graciously hath brought to light
33513 This dangerous treason lurking in our way
33514 To hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
33515 But every rub is smoothed on our way
33516 Then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
33517 Our puissance into the hand of God
33518 Putting it straight in expedition
33519 Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
33520 No king of England if not king of France

33536 between twelve and one ev'n at the turning o th tide for
33537 after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers
33538 and smile upon his fingers end I knew there was but one way
33539 for his nose was as sharp as a pen and 'a babbl'd of green
33540 fields 'How now Sir John quoth I 'What man be o good
33541 cheer So 'a cried out 'God God God three or four times Now
33542 I to comfort him bid him 'a should not think of God I hop'd
33543 there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet
33544 So 'a bade me lay more clothes on his feet I put my hand into

33579 SCENE IV
33580 France The KING'S palace
33581 Flourish Enter the FRENCH KING the DAUPHIN the DUKES OF BERRI
33582 and BRITAINE the CONSTABLE and others
33583 FRENCH KING Thus comes the English with full power upon us
33584 And more than carefully it us concerns
33585 To answer royally in our defences
33586 Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine
33587 Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth
33588 And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch
33589 To line and new repair our towns of war
33590 With men of courage and with means defendant
33591 For England his approaches makes as fierce
33592 As waters to the sucking of a gulf
33593 It fits us then to be as provident
33594 As fear may teach us out of late examples
33595 Left by the fatal and neglected English
33596 Upon our fields
33597 DAUPHIN My most redoubted father
33598 It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe
33599 For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
33600 Though war nor no known quarrel were in question
33601 But that defences musters preparations
33602 Should be maintain'd assembled and collected
33603 As were a war in expectation
33604 Therefore I say 'tis meet we all go forth
33605 To view the sick and feeble parts of France
33606 And let us do it with no show of fear
33607 No with no more than if we heard that England
33608 Were busied with a Whitsun morrisdance
33609 For my good liege she is so idly king'd
33610 Her sceptre so fantastically borne
33611 By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
33612 That fear attends her not
33613 CONSTABLE O peace Prince Dauphin
33614 You are too much mistaken in this king
33615 Question your Grace the late ambassadors
33616 With what great state he heard their embassy
33617 How well supplied with noble counsellors
33618 How modest in exception and withal
33619 How terrible in constant resolution
33620 And you shall find his vanities forespent
33621 Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
33622 Covering discretion with a coat of folly
33623 As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
33624 That shall first spring and be most delicate
33625 DAUPHIN Well 'tis not so my Lord High Constable
33626 But though we think it so it is no matter
33627 In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
33628 The enemy more mighty than he seems
33629 So the proportions of defence are fill'd
33630 Which of a weak and niggardly projection
33631 Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
33632 A little cloth
33633 FRENCH KING Think we King Harry strong
33634 And Princes look you strongly arm to meet him
33635 The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us
33636 And he is bred out of that bloody strain
33637 That haunted us in our familiar paths
33638 Witness our too much memorable shame
33639 When Cressy battle fatally was struck
33640 And all our princes capdv'd by the hand
33641 Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales
33642 Whiles that his mountain sire on mountain standing
33643 Up in the air crown'd with the golden sun
33644 Saw his heroical seed and smil'd to see him
33645 Mangle the work of nature and deface
33646 The patterns that by God and by French fathers
33647 Had twenty years been made This is a stern
33648 Of that victorious stock and let us fear
33649 The native mightiness and fate of him
33650 Enter a MESSENGER
33651 MESSENGER Ambassadors from Harry King of England
33652 Do crave admittance to your Majesty
33653 FRENCH KING We'll give them present audience Go and bring them
33654 Exeunt MESSENGER and certain LORDS
33655 You see this chase is hotly followed friends
33656 DAUPHIN Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
33657 Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
33658 Runs far before them Good my sovereign
33659 Take up the English short and let them know
33660 Of what a monarchy you are the head
33661 Selflove my liege is not so vile a sin
33662 As selfneglecting
33663 Reenter LORDS with EXETER and train
33664 FRENCH KING From our brother of England
33665 EXETER From him and thus he greets your Majesty
33666 He wills you in the name of God Almighty
33667 That you divest yourself and lay apart
33668 The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven
33669 By law of nature and of nations 'longs
33670 To him and to his heirs namely the crown
33671 And all widestretched honours that pertain
33672 By custom and the ordinance of times
33673 Unto the crown of France That you may know
33674 'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
33675 Pick'd from the wormholes of longvanish'd days
33676 Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd
33677 He sends you this most memorable line [Gives a paper]
33678 In every branch truly demonstrative
33679 Willing you overlook this pedigree
33680 And when you find him evenly deriv'd
33681 From his most fam'd of famous ancestors
33682 Edward the Third he bids you then resign
33683 Your crown and kingdom indirectly held
33684 From him the native and true challenger
33685 FRENCH KING Or else what follows
33686 EXETER Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
33687 Even in your hearts there will he rake for it
33688 Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
33689 In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove
33690 That if requiring fail he will compel
33691 And bids you in the bowels of the Lord
33692 Deliver up the crown and to take mercy
33693 On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
33694 Opens his vasty jaws and on your head
33695 Turning the widows tears the orphans cries
33696 The dead men's blood the privy maidens groans
33697 For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
33698 That shall be swallowed in this controversy
33699 This is his claim his threat'ning and my message
33700 Unless the Dauphin be in presence here
33701 To whom expressly I bring greeting too
33702 FRENCH KING For us we will consider of this further
33703 Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
33704 Back to our brother of England
33705 DAUPHIN For the Dauphin
33706 I stand here for him What to him from England
33707 EXETER Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
33708 And anything that may not misbecome
33709 The mighty sender doth he prize you at
33710 Thus says my king an if your father's Highness
33711 Do not in grant of all demands at large
33712 Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty
33713 He'll call you to so hot an answer of it
33714 That caves and womby vaultages of France
33715 Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
33716 In second accent of his ordinance
33717 DAUPHIN Say if my father render fair return
33718 It is against my will for I desire
33719 Nothing but odds with England To that end
33720 As matching to his youth and vanity
33721 I did present him with the Paris balls
33722 EXETER He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it
33723 Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe
33724 And be assur'd you'll find a difference
33725 As we his subjects have in wonder found
33726 Between the promise of his greener days
33727 And these he masters now Now he weighs time
33728 Even to the utmost grain that you shall read
33729 In your own losses if he stay in France
33730 FRENCH KING Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
33731 EXETER Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
33732 Come here himself to question our delay
33733 For he is footed in this land already
33734 FRENCH KING You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions
33735 A night is but small breath and little pause
33736 To answer matters of this consequence Flourish Exeunt

33754 Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
33755 Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
33756 To sounds confus'd behold the threaden sails
33757 Borne with th invisible and creeping wind
33758 Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea
33759 Breasting the lofty surge O do but think
33760 You stand upon the rivage and behold
33761 A city on th inconstant billows dancing
33762 For so appears this fleet majestical
33763 Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow

33765 And leave your England as dead midnight still
33766 Guarded with grandsires babies and old women
33767 Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance
33768 For who is he whose chin is but enrich'd
33769 With one appearing hair that will not follow
33770 These cull'd and choicedrawn cavaliers to France
33771 Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
33772 Behold the ordnance on their carriages
33773 With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur
33774 Suppose th ambassador from the French comes back
33775 Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
33776 Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry
33777 Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms

33794 and soldiers with scalingladders
33795 KING Once more unto the breach dear friends once more
33796 Or close the wall up with our English dead
33797 In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
33798 As modest stillness and humility
33799 But when the blast of war blows in our ears
33800 Then imitate the action of the tiger
33801 Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
33802 Disguise fair nature with hardfavour'd rage
33803 Then lend the eye a terrible aspect
33804 Let it pry through the portage of the head
33805 Like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it
33806 As fearfully as doth a galled rock
33807 O'erhang and jutty his confounded base
33808 Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean
33809 Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
33810 Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
33811 To his full height On on you noblest English
33812 Whose blood is fet from fathers of warproof
33813 Fathers that like so many Alexanders
33814 Have in these parts from morn till even fought
33815 And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument
33816 Dishonour not your mothers now attest
33817 That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you
33818 Be copy now to men of grosser blood
33819 And teach them how to war And you good yeomen
33820 Whose limbs were made in England show us here
33821 The mettle of your pasture let us swear
33822 That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not
33823 For there is none of you so mean and base
33824 That hath not noble lustre in your eyes
33825 I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
33826 Straining upon the start The game's afoot
33827 Follow your spirit and upon this charge
33828 Cry 'God for Harry England and Saint George'

33834 NYM Pray thee Corporal stay the knocks are too hot and for
33835 mine own part I have not a case of lives The humour of it is too
33836 hot that is the very plainsong of it
33837 PISTOL The plainsong is most just for humours do abound
33838 Knocks go and come God's vassals drop and die
33839 And sword and shield
33840 In bloody field
33841 Doth win immortal fame

33843 fame for a pot of ale and safety
33844 PISTOL And I
33845 If wishes would prevail with me

33858 Exeunt all but BOY
33859 BOY As young as I am I have observ'd these three swashers I am
33860 boy to them all three but all they three though they would
33861 serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do
33862 not amount to a man For Bardolph he is whiteliver'd and
33863 redfac'd by the means whereof 'a faces it out but fights not
33864 For Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the
33865 means whereof 'a breaks words and keeps whole weapons For Nym
33866 he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and
33867 therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest 'a should be thought
33868 a coward but his few bad words are match'd with as few good
33869 deeds for 'a never broke any man's head but his own and that
33870 was against a post when he was drunk They will steal anything
33871 and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lutecase bore it twelve
33872 leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph are
33873 sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a
33874 fireshovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry
33875 coals They would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their
33876 gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my
33877 manhood if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine
33878 for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and
33879 seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak
33880 stomach and therefore I must cast it up Exit

34157 GOWER How now Captain Fluellen Come you from the bridge
34158 FLUELLEN I assure you there is very excellent services committed
34159 at the bridge
34160 GOWER Is the Duke of Exeter safe
34161 FLUELLEN The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon and a
34162 man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my
34163 duty and my live and my living and my uttermost power He is
34164 not God be praised and blessed any hurt in the world but
34165 keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline There
34166 is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge I think in my
34167 very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is
34168 man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as
34169 gallant service
34170 GOWER What do you call him
34171 FLUELLEN He is call'd Aunchient Pistol
34172 GOWER I know him not
34173 Enter PISTOL
34174 FLUELLEN Here is the man
34175 PISTOL Captain I thee beseech to do me favours
34176 The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well
34177 FLUELLEN Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his
34178 hands
34179 PISTOL Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
34180 And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
34181 And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel
34182 That goddess blind
34183 That stands upon the rolling restless stone
34184 FLUELLEN By your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is painted
34185 blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that
34186 Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to
34187 signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning
34188 and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look
34189 you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and
34190 rolls In good truth the poet makes a most excellent description
34191 of it Fortune is an excellent moral
34192 PISTOL Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him
34193 For he hath stol'n a pax and hanged must 'a be
34194 A damned death
34195 Let gallows gape for dog let man go free
34196 And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
34197 But Exeter hath given the doom of death
34198 For pax of little price
34199 Therefore go speak the Duke will hear thy voice
34200 And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
34201 With edge of penny cord and vile reproach
34202 Speak Captain for his life and I will thee requite
34203 FLUELLEN Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning
34204 PISTOL Why then rejoice therefore
34205 FLUELLEN Certainly Aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at
34206 for if look you he were my brother I would desire the Duke to
34207 use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline
34208 ought to be used

34211 PISTOL The fig of Spain Exit
34212 FLUELLEN Very good
34213 GOWER Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember him
34214 now a bawd a cutpurse
34215 FLUELLEN I'll assure you 'a utt'red as prave words at the pridge
34216 as you shall see in a summer's day But it is very well what he
34217 has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is serve
34218 GOWER Why 'tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to
34219 the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the
34220 form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great
34221 commanders names and they will learn you by rote where services
34222 were done at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a
34223 convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgrac'd what
34224 terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the
34225 phrase of war which they trick up with newtuned oaths and what
34226 a beard of the General's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will
34227 do among foaming bottles and alewash'd wits is wonderful to be
34228 thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the age
34229 or else you may be marvellously mistook
34230 FLUELLEN I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is not
34231 the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if I
34232 find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind [Drum within]
34233 Hark you the King is coming and I must speak with him from the
34234 pridge

34242 athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced

34244 tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man
34245 KING HENRY What men have you lost Fluellen
34246 FLUELLEN The perdition of th athversary hath been very great
34247 reasonable great marry for my part I think the Duke hath lost
34248 never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a
34249 church one Bardolph if your Majesty know the man his face is
34250 all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o fire and his
34251 lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes
34252 plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire's
34253 out
34254 KING HENRY We would have all such offenders so cut off And we
34255 give express charge that in our marches through the country there
34256 be nothing compell'd from the villages nothing taken but paid
34257 for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
34258 language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
34259 gentler gamester is the soonest winner

34265 MONTJOY Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England Though we
34266 seem'd dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than
34267 rashness Tell him we could have rebuk'd him at Harfleur but
34268 that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
34269 ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial
34270 England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our
34271 sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must
34272 proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost
34273 the disgrace we have digested which in weight to reanswer his
34274 pettiness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is too
34275 poor for th effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom
34276 too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling
34277 at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this add
34278 defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
34279 followers whose condemnation is pronounc'd So far my king and
34280 master so much my office
34281 KING HENRY What is thy name I know thy quality
34282 MONTJOY Montjoy
34283 KING HENRY Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back
34284 And tell thy king I do not seek him now
34285 But could be willing to march on to Calais
34286 Without impeachment for to say the sooth
34287 Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
34288 Unto an enemy of craft and vantage
34289 My people are with sickness much enfeebled
34290 My numbers lessen'd and those few I have
34291 Almost no better than so many French
34292 Who when they were in health I tell thee herald
34293 I thought upon one pair of English legs
34294 Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God
34295 That I do brag thus this your air of France
34296 Hath blown that vice in me I must repent
34297 Go therefore tell thy master here I am
34298 My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
34299 My army but a weak and sickly guard
34300 Yet God before tell him we will come on
34301 Though France himself and such another neighbour
34302 Stand in our way There's for thy labour Montjoy
34303 Go bid thy master well advise himself
34304 If we may pass we will if we be hind'red
34305 We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
34306 Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well
34307 The sum of all our answer is but this
34308 We would not seek a battle as we are
34309 Nor as we are we say we will not shun it
34310 So tell your master
34311 MONTJOY I shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness Exit
34312 GLOUCESTER I hope they will not come upon us now
34313 KING HENRY We are in God's hand brother not in theirs

34330 world
34331 DAUPHIN What a long night is this I will not change my horse with
34332 any that treads but on four pasterns Ca ha he bounds from the
34333 earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the
34334 Pegasus chez les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I
34335 am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it
34336 the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of
34337 Hermes
34338 ORLEANS He's of the colour of the nutmeg
34339 DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus
34340 he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water
34341 never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his
34342 rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
34343 may call beasts
34344 CONSTABLE Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent
34345 horse
34346 DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
34347 bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
34348 ORLEANS No more cousin
34349 DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of
34350 the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my
34351 palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into
34352 eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all 'tis a
34353 subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign's
34354 sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and
34355 unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at
34356 him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus 'Wonder
34357 of nature'
34358 ORLEANS I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress

34360 for my horse is my mistress
34361 ORLEANS Your mistress bears well
34362 DAUPHIN Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a
34363 good and particular mistress

34365 shook your back
34366 DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours
34367 CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled
34368 DAUPHIN O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a
34369 kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait
34370 strossers
34371 CONSTABLE You have good judgment in horsemanship
34372 DAUPHIN Be warn'd by me then they that ride so and ride not
34373 warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my
34374 mistress
34375 CONSTABLE I had as lief have my mistress a jade
34376 DAUPHIN I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hair
34377 CONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to
34378 my mistress
34379 DAUPHIN 'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la
34380 truie lavee au bourbier Thou mak'st use of anything
34381 CONSTABLE Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such
34382 proverb so little kin to the purpose
34383 RAMBURES My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent
34384 tonight are those stars or suns upon it
34385 CONSTABLE Stars my lord
34386 DAUPHIN Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope
34387 CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want
34388 DAUPHIN That may be for you bear a many superfluously and 'twere
34389 more honour some were away
34390 CONSTABLE Ev'n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as
34391 well were some of your brags dismounted
34392 DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it
34393 never be day I will trot tomorrow a mile and my way shall be
34394 paved with English faces
34395 CONSTABLE I will not say so for fear I should be fac'd out of my
34396 way but I would it were morning for I would fain be about the
34397 ears of the English
34398 RAMBURES Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
34399 CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
34400 DAUPHIN 'Tis midnight I'll go arm myself Exit
34401 ORLEANS The Dauphin longs for morning
34402 RAMBURES He longs to eat the English
34403 CONSTABLE I think he will eat all he kills
34404 ORLEANS By the white hand of my lady he's a gallant prince
34405 CONSTABLE Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
34406 ORLEANS He is simply the most active gentleman of France
34407 CONSTABLE Doing is activity and he will still be doing
34408 ORLEANS He never did harm that I heard of
34409 CONSTABLE Nor will do none tomorrow he will keep that good name
34410 still
34411 ORLEANS I know him to be valiant
34412 CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than you
34413 ORLEANS What's he
34414 CONSTABLE Marry he told me so himself and he said he car'd not
34415 who knew it
34416 ORLEANS He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
34417 CONSTABLE By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but
34418 his lackey
34419 'Tis a hooded valour and when it appears it will bate
34420 ORLEANS Illwind never said well
34421 CONSTABLE I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in
34422 friendship'
34423 ORLEANS And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due'
34424 CONSTABLE Well plac'd There stands your friend for the devil
34425 have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A pox of the devil'
34426 ORLEANS You are the better at proverbs by how much 'A fool's bolt
34427 is soon shot'
34428 CONSTABLE You have shot over
34429 ORLEANS 'Tis not the first time you were overshot

34431 MESSENGER My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen
34432 hundred paces of your tents
34433 CONSTABLE Who hath measur'd the ground
34434 MESSENGER The Lord Grandpre
34435 CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day
34436 Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we
34437 do
34438 ORLEANS What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of
34439 England to mope with his fatbrain'd followers so far out of his
34440 knowledge
34441 CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension they would run
34442 away
34443 ORLEANS That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual
34444 armour they could never wear such heavy headpieces
34445 RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures
34446 their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
34447 ORLEANS Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian
34448 bear and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples You may as
34449 well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the
34450 lip of a lion
34451 CONSTABLE Just just and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs
34452 in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their
34453 wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel
34454 they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
34455 ORLEANS Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef
34456 CONSTABLE Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to
34457 eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we
34458 about it
34459 ORLEANS It is now two o'clock but let me see by ten
34460 We shall have each a hundred Englishmen Exeunt

34470 Enter CHORUS
34471 CHORUS Now entertain conjecture of a time
34472 When creeping murmur and the poring dark
34473 Fills the wide vessel of the universe
34474 From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
34475 The hum of either army stilly sounds
34476 That the fix'd sentinels almost receive
34477 The secret whispers of each other's watch
34478 Fire answers fire and through their paly flames
34479 Each battle sees the other's umber'd face
34480 Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
34481 Piercing the night's dull ear and from the tents
34482 The armourers accomplishing the knights
34483 With busy hammers closing rivets up
34484 Give dreadful note of preparation
34485 The country cocks do crow the clocks do ton
34486 And the third hour of drowsy morning name
34487 Proud of their numbers and secure in soul
34488 The confident and overlusty French
34489 Do the lowrated English play at dice
34490 And chide the cripple tardygaited night
34491 Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
34492 So tediously away The poor condemned English
34493 Like sacrifices by their watchful fires
34494 Sit patiently and inly ruminate
34495 The morning's danger and their gesture sad
34496 Investing lanklean cheeks and warworn coats
34497 Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
34498 So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold
34499 The royal captain of this ruin'd band
34500 Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
34501 Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head'
34502 For forth he goes and visits all his host
34503 Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
34504 And calls them brothers friends and countrymen
34505 Upon his royal face there is no note
34506 How dread an army hath enrounded him
34507 Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
34508 Unto the weary and allwatched night
34509 But freshly looks and overbears attaint
34510 With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
34511 That every wretch pining and pale before
34512 Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
34513 A largess universal like the sun
34514 His liberal eye doth give to every one
34515 Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
34516 Behold as may unworthiness define
34517 A little touch of Harry in the night
34518 And so our scene must to the battle fly
34519 Where O for pity we shall much disgrace
34520 With four or five most vile and ragged foils
34521 Right illdispos'd in brawl ridiculous
34522 The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see
34523 Minding true things by what their mock'ries be Exit
34524 SCENE I
34525 France The English camp at Agincourt
34526 Enter the KING BEDFORD and GLOUCESTER
34527 KING HENRY Gloucester 'tis true that we are in great danger
34528 The greater therefore should our courage be
34529 Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty
34530 There is some soul of goodness in things evil
34531 Would men observingly distil it out
34532 For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
34533 Which is both healthful and good husbandry
34534 Besides they are our outward consciences
34535 And preachers to us all admonishing
34536 That we should dress us fairly for our end
34537 Thus may we gather honey from the weed
34538 And make a moral of the devil himself
34539 Enter ERPINGHAM
34540 Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
34541 A good soft pillow for that good white head
34542 Were better than a churlish turf of France
34543 ERPINGHAM Not so my liege this lodging likes me better
34544 Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king'
34545 KING HENRY 'Tis good for men to love their present pains
34546 Upon example so the spirit is eased
34547 And when the mind is quick'ned out of doubt
34548 The organs though defunct and dead before
34549 Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
34550 With casted slough and fresh legerity
34551 Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both

34557 KING HENRY No my good knight
34558 Go with my brothers to my lords of England
34559 I and my bosom must debate awhile
34560 And then I would no other company
34561 ERPINGHAM The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry

34571 KING HENRY Even so What are you
34572 PISTOL As good a gentleman as the Emperor
34573 KING HENRY Then you are a better than the King
34574 PISTOL The King's a bawcock and a heart of gold
34575 A lad of life an imp of fame
34576 Of parents good of fist most valiant

34583 KING HENRY Yes
34584 PISTOL Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate
34585 Upon Saint Davy's day
34586 KING HENRY Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest
34587 he knock that about yours

34593 KING HENRY It sorts well with your fierceness
34594 Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
34595 GOWER Captain Fluellen
34596 FLUELLEN So in the name of Jesu Christ speak fewer It is the
34597 greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and
34598 aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you
34599 would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great
34600 you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddletaddle nor
34601 pibblepabble in Pompey's camp I warrant you you shall find the
34602 ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it
34603 and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
34604 GOWER Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
34605 FLUELLEN If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
34606 coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be
34607 an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb In your own
34608 conscience now
34609 GOWER I will speak lower
34610 FLUELLEN I pray you and beseech you that you will
34611 Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN
34612 KING HENRY Though it appear a little out of fashion
34613 There is much care and valour in this Welshman
34614 Enter three soldiers JOHN BATES ALEXANDER COURT
34615 and MICHAEL WILLIAMS
34616 COURT Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks
34617 yonder
34618 BATES I think it be but we have no great cause to desire the
34619 approach of day
34620 WILLIAMS We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we
34621 shall never see the end of it Who goes there
34622 KING HENRY A friend
34623 WILLIAMS Under what captain serve you
34624 KING HENRY Under Sir Thomas Erpingham
34625 WILLIAMS A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray
34626 you what thinks he of our estate
34627 KING HENRY Even as men wreck'd upon a sand that look to be wash'd
34628 off the next tide
34629 BATES He hath not told his thought to the King
34630 KING HENRY No nor it is not meet he should For though I speak it
34631 to you I think the King is but a man as I am the violet smells
34632 to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to
34633 me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid
34634 by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his
34635 affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop
34636 they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason of
34637 fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
34638 as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any
34639 appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his
34640 army
34641 BATES He may show what outward courage he will but I believe as
34642 cold a night as 'tis he could wish himself in Thames up to the
34643 neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so
34644 we were quit here
34645 KING HENRY By my troth I will speak my conscience of the King I
34646 think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is
34647 BATES Then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be
34648 ransomed and a many poor men's lives saved
34649 KING HENRY I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
34650 alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds
34651 methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's
34652 company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
34653 WILLIAMS That's more than we know
34654 BATES Ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if
34655 we know we are the King's subjects If his cause be wrong our
34656 obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us
34657 WILLIAMS But if the cause be not good the King himself hath a
34658 heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads
34659 chopp'd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day
34660 and cry all 'We died at such a place some swearing some crying
34661 for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some
34662 upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I
34663 am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how
34664 can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their
34665 argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black
34666 matter for the King that led them to it who to disobey were
34667 against all proportion of subjection
34668 KING HENRY So if a son that is by his father sent about
34669 merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of
34670 his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father
34671 that sent him or if a servant under his master's command
34672 transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
34673 many irreconcil'd iniquities you may call the business of the
34674 master the author of the servant's damnation But this is not so
34675 the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his
34676 soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant
34677 for they purpose not their death when they purpose their
34678 services Besides there is no king be his cause never so
34679 spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out
34680 with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the
34681 guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling
34682 virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars
34683 their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace
34684 with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law
34685 and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they
34686 have no wings to fly from God war is His beadle war is His
34687 vengeance so that here men are punish'd for beforebreach of the
34688 King's laws in now the King's quarrel Where they feared the
34689 death they have borne life away and where they would be safe
34690 they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the King
34691 guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those
34692 impieties for the which they are now visited Every subject's
34693 duty is the King's but every subject's soul is his own
34694 Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man
34695 in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so
34696 death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly
34697 lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes
34698 it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer He
34699 let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
34700 others how they should prepare
34701 WILLIAMS 'Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his
34702 own head the King is not to answer for it
34703 BATES I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine
34704 to fight lustily for him
34705 KING HENRY I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom'd
34706 WILLIAMS Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our
34707 throats are cut he may be ransom'd and we ne'er the wiser
34708 KING HENRY If I live to see it I will never trust his word after
34709 WILLIAMS You pay him then That's a perilous shot out of an
34710 eldergun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a
34711 monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with
34712 fanning in his face with a peacock's feather You'll never trust
34713 his word after Come 'tis a foolish saying
34714 KING HENRY Your reproof is something too round I should be angry
34715 with you if the time were convenient
34716 WILLIAMS Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
34717 KING HENRY I embrace it
34718 WILLIAMS How shall I know thee again
34719 KING HENRY Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my
34720 bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it I will make it
34721 my quarrel
34722 WILLIAMS Here's my glove give me another of thine
34723 KING HENRY There
34724 WILLIAMS This will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me
34725 and say after tomorrow 'This is my glove by this hand I will
34726 take thee a box on the ear
34727 KING HENRY If ever I live to see it I will challenge it
34728 WILLIAMS Thou dar'st as well be hang'd
34729 KING HENRY Well I will do it though I take thee in the King's
34730 company
34731 WILLIAMS Keep thy word Fare thee well
34732 BATES Be friends you English fools be friends we have
34733 French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
34734 KING HENRY Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one
34735 they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it
34736 is no English treason to cut French crowns and tomorrow the
34737 King himself will be a clipper
34738 Exeunt soldiers
34739 Upon the King Let us our lives our souls
34740 Our debts our careful wives
34741 Our children and our sins lay on the King
34742 We must bear all O hard condition
34743 Twinborn with greatness subject to the breath
34744 Of every fool whose sense no more can feel
34745 But his own wringing What infinite heart's ease
34746 Must kings neglect that private men enjoy
34747 And what have kings that privates have not too
34748 Save ceremony save general ceremony
34749 And what art thou thou idol Ceremony
34750 What kind of god art thou that suffer'st more
34751 Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
34752 What are thy rents What are thy comingsin
34753 O Ceremony show me but thy worth
34754 What is thy soul of adoration
34755 Art thou aught else but place degree and form
34756 Creating awe and fear in other men
34757 Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
34758 Than they in fearing
34759 What drink'st thou oft instead of homage sweet
34760 But poison'd flattery O be sick great greatness
34761 And bid thy ceremony give thee cure
34762 Thinks thou the fiery fever will go out
34763 With titles blown from adulation
34764 Will it give place to flexure and low bending
34765 Canst thou when thou command'st the beggar's knee
34766 Command the health of it No thou proud dream
34767 That play'st so subtly with a king's repose
34768 I am a king that find thee and I know
34769 'Tis not the balm the sceptre and the ball
34770 The sword the mace the crown imperial
34771 The intertissued robe of gold and pearl
34772 The farced tide running fore the king
34773 The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
34774 That beats upon the high shore of this world
34775 No not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony
34776 Not all these laid in bed majestical
34777 Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
34778 Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
34779 Gets him to rest cramm'd with distressful bread
34780 Never sees horrid night the child of hell
34781 But like a lackey from the rise to set
34782 Sweats in the eye of Pheebus and all night
34783 Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn
34784 Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse
34785 And follows so the everrunning year
34786 With profitable labour to his grave
34787 And but for ceremony such a wretch
34788 Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
34789 Had the forehand and vantage of a king
34790 The slave a member of the country's peace
34791 Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
34792 What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
34793 Whose hours the peasant best advantages

34805 O not today think not upon the fault
34806 My father made in compassing the crown
34807 I Richard's body have interred new
34808 And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
34809 Than from it issued forced drops of blood
34810 Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
34811 Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold up
34812 Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built
34813 Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
34814 Sing still for Richard's soul More will I do
34815 Though all that I can do is nothing worth
34816 Since that my penitence comes after all
34817 Imploring pardon

34843 Do but behold yon poor and starved band
34844 And your fair show shall suck away their souls
34845 Leaving them but the shales and husks of men
34846 There is not work enough for all our hands
34847 Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
34848 To give each naked curtleaxe a stain
34849 That our French gallants shall today draw out
34850 And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them
34851 The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them
34852 'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions lords
34853 That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants
34854 Who in unnecessary action swarm
34855 About our squares of battle were enow
34856 To purge this field of such a hilding foe
34857 Though we upon this mountain's basis by
34858 Took stand for idle speculation
34859 But that our honours must not What's to say
34860 A very little little let us do
34861 And all is done Then let the trumpets sound

34867 Yond island carrions desperate of their bones
34868 Illfavouredly become the morning field
34869 Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
34870 And our air shakes them passing scornfully
34871 Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
34872 And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
34873 The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
34874 With torchstaves in their hand and their poor jades
34875 Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
34876 The gum downroping from their paledead eyes
34877 And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit
34878 Lies foul with chaw'd grass still and motionless
34879 And their executors the knavish crows
34880 Fly o'er them all impatient for their hour
34881 Description cannot suit itself in words
34882 To demonstrate the life of such a battle
34883 In life so lifeless as it shows itself
34884 CONSTABLE They have said their prayers and they stay for death
34885 DAUPHIN Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
34886 And give their fasting horses provender

34906 BEDFORD Farewell good Salisbury and good luck go with thee
34907 EXETER Farewell kind lord Fight valiantly today

34916 That do no work today
34917 KING What's he that wishes so
34918 My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin
34919 If we are mark'd to die we are enow
34920 To do our country loss and if to live
34921 The fewer men the greater share of honour
34922 God's will I pray thee wish not one man more
34923 By Jove I am not covetous for gold
34924 Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost
34925 It yearns me not if men my garments wear
34926 Such outward things dwell not in my desires
34927 But if it be a sin to covet honour
34928 I am the most offending soul alive
34929 No faith my coz wish not a man from England
34930 God's peace I would not lose so great an honour
34931 As one man more methinks would share from me
34932 For the best hope I have O do not wish one more
34933 Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host
34934 That he which hath no stomach to this fight
34935 Let him depart his passport shall be made
34936 And crowns for convoy put into his purse
34937 We would not die in that man's company
34938 That fears his fellowship to die with us
34939 This day is call'd the feast of Crispian
34940 He that outlives this day and comes safe home
34941 Will stand a tiptoe when this day is nam'd
34942 And rouse him at the name of Crispian
34943 He that shall live this day and see old age
34944 Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
34945 And say 'Tomorrow is Saint Crispian'
34946 Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
34947 And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day'
34948 Old men forget yet all shall be forgot
34949 But he'll remember with advantages
34950 What feats he did that day Then shall our names
34951 Familiar in his mouth as household words
34952 Harry the King Bedford and Exeter
34953 Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester
34954 Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red
34955 This story shall the good man teach his son
34956 And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by
34957 From this day to the ending of the world
34958 But we in it shall be remembered
34959 We few we happy few we band of brothers
34960 For he today that sheds his blood with me
34961 Shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile
34962 This day shall gentle his condition
34963 And gentlemen in England nowabed
34964 Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here

34973 KING HENRY Thou dost not wish more help from England coz
34974 WESTMORELAND God's will my liege would you and I alone
34975 Without more help could fight this royal battle

34980 MONTJOY Once more I come to know of thee King Harry
34981 If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
34982 Before thy most assured overthrow
34983 For certainly thou art so near the gulf
34984 Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy
34985 The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
34986 Thy followers of repentance that their souls
34987 May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
34988 From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
34989 Must lie and fester
34990 KING HENRY Who hath sent thee now
34991 MONTJOY The Constable of France
34992 KING HENRY I pray thee bear my former answer back
34993 Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
34994 Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus
34995 The man that once did sell the lion's skin
34996 While the beast liv'd was kill'd with hunting him
34997 A many of our bodies shall no doubt
34998 Find native graves upon the which I trust
34999 Shall witness live in brass of this day's work
35000 And those that leave their valiant bones in France
35001 Dying like men though buried in your dunghills
35002 They shall be fam'd for there the sun shall greet them
35003 And draw their honours reeking up to heaven
35004 Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
35005 The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France
35006 Mark then abounding valour in our English
35007 That being dead like to the bullet's grazing
35008 Break out into a second course of mischief
35009 Killing in relapse of mortality
35010 Let me speak proudly tell the Constable
35011 We are but warriors for the workingday
35012 Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
35013 With rainy marching in the painful field
35014 There's not a piece of feather in our host
35015 Good argument I hope we will not fly
35016 And time hath worn us into slovenry
35017 But by the mass our hearts are in the trim
35018 And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
35019 They'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck
35020 The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers heads
35021 And turn them out of service If they do this
35022 As if God please they shall my ransom then
35023 Will soon be levied Herald save thou thy labour
35024 Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
35025 They shall have none I swear but these my joints
35026 Which if they have as I will leave 'em them
35027 Shall yield them little tell the Constable

35637 Of this good day and of this gracious meeting
35638 As we are now glad to behold your eyes
35639 Your eyes which hitherto have home in them
35640 Against the French that met them in their bent
35641 The fatal balls of murdering basilisks
35642 The venom of such looks we fairly hope
35643 Have lost their quality and that this day
35644 Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
35645 KING HENRY To cry amen to that thus we appear
35646 QUEEN ISABEL You English princes an I do salute you
35647 BURGUNDY My duty to you both on equal love

35651 Unto this bar and royal interview
35652 Your mightiness on both parts best can witness
35653 Since then my office hath so far prevail'd
35654 That face to face and royal eye to eye
35655 You have congreeted let it not disgrace me
35656 If I demand before this royal view
35657 What rub or what impediment there is
35658 Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace
35659 Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births
35660 Should not in this best garden of the world
35661 Our fertile France put up her lovely visage
35662 Alas she hath from France too long been chas'd
35663 And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
35664 Corrupting in it own fertility
35665 Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
35666 Unpruned dies her hedges evenpleach'd
35667 Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
35668 Put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas
35669 The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
35670 Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
35671 That should deracinate such savagery
35672 The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
35673 The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
35674 Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
35675 Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
35676 But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
35677 Losing both beauty and utility
35678 And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
35679 Defective in their natures grow to wildness
35680 Even so our houses and ourselves and children
35681 Have lost or do not learn for want of time
35682 The sciences that should become our country
35683 But grow like savages as soldiers will
35684 That nothing do but meditate on blood
35685 To swearing and stern looks diffus'd attire
35686 And everything that seems unnatural
35687 Which to reduce into our former favout
35688 You are assembled and my speech entreats
35689 That I may know the let why gentle Peace
35690 Should not expel these inconveniences
35691 And bless us with her former qualities
35692 KING HENRY If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace
35693 Whose want gives growth to th imperfections
35694 Which you have cited you must buy that peace
35695 With full accord to all our just demands
35696 Whose tenours and particular effects
35697 You have enschedul'd briefly in your hands
35698 BURGUNDY The King hath heard them to the which as yet
35699 There is no answer made

35725 KING HENRY Fair Katherine and most fair
35726 Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
35727 Such as will enter at a lady's ear
35728 And plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart
35729 KATHERINE Your Majesty shall mock me I cannot speak your England
35730 KING HENRY O fair Katherine if you will love me soundly with your
35731 French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with
35732 your English tongue Do you like me Kate
35733 KATHERINE Pardonnezmoi I cannot tell vat is like me
35734 KING HENRY An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
35735 KATHERINE Que ditil que je suis semblable a les anges
35736 ALICE Oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi ditil
35737 KING HENRY I said so dear Katherine and I must not blush to
35738 affirm it
35739 KATHERINE O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
35740 tromperies
35741 KING HENRY What says she fair one that the tongues of men are
35742 full of deceits
35743 ALICE Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is
35744 de Princess
35745 KING HENRY The Princess is the better Englishwoman I faith
35746 Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou
35747 canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst
35748 find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my
35749 farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but
35750 directly to say 'I love you Then if you urge me farther than
35751 to say 'Do you in faith I wear out my suit Give me your
35752 answer i faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say
35753 you lady
35754 KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur me understand well
35755 KING HENRY Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
35756 your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither
35757 words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in
35758 measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a
35759 lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour
35760 on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I
35761 should quickly leap into wife Or if I might buffet for my love
35762 or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher
35763 and sit like a jackanapes never off But before God Kate I
35764 cannot look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor I have no
35765 cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use
35766 till urg'd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a
35767 fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning
35768 that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there
35769 let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou
35770 canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I
35771 shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love
35772 thee too And while thou liv'st dear Kate take a fellow of
35773 plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right
35774 because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these
35775 fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into
35776 ladies favours they do always reason themselves out again
35777 What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good
35778 leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will
35779 turn white a curl'd pate will grow bald a fair face will
35780 wither a full eye will wax hollow But a good heart Kate is
35781 the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for
35782 it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
35783 If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a
35784 soldier take a soldier take a king And what say'st thou then
35785 to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee
35786 KATHERINE Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
35787 KING HENRY No it is not possible you should love the enemy of
35788 France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of
35789 France for I love France so well that I will not part with a
35790 village of it I will have it all mine And Kate when France is
35791 mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine
35792 KATHERINE I cannot tell vat is dat
35793 KING HENRY No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure
35794 will hang upon my tongue like a newmarried wife about her
35795 husband's neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le
35796 possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moi
35797 let me see what then Saint Denis be my speed donc votre est
35798 France et vous etes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to
35799 conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall
35800 never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me
35801 KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur le Francais que vous parlez il est
35802 meilleur que l'Anglais lequel je parle
35803 KING HENRY No faith is't not Kate but thy speaking of my
35804 tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to
35805 be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much
35806 English Canst thou love me
35807 KATHERINE I cannot tell
35808 KING HENRY Can any of your neighbours tell Kate I'll ask them
35809 Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into
35810 your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me and I
35811 know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you
35812 love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the
35813 rather gentle Princess because I love thee cruelly If ever
35814 thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells
35815 me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore
35816 needs prove a good soldierbreeder Shall not thou and I between
35817 Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half
35818 English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the
35819 beard Shall we not What say'st thou my fair flowerdeluce
35820 KATHERINE I do not know dat
35821 KING HENRY No 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but
35822 now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of
35823 such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and
35824 a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde mon
35825 tres cher et divin deesse
35826 KATHERINE Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
35827 most sage damoiselle dat is en France
35828 KING HENRY Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true
35829 English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou
35830 lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost
35831 notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now
35832 beshrew my father's ambition He was thinking of civil wars when
35833 he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with
35834 an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them
35835 But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear
35836 my comfort is that old age that in layerup of beauty can do
35837 no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the
35838 worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and
35839 better And therefore tell me most fair Katherine will you have
35840 me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your
35841 heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say
35842 'Harry of England I am thine Which word thou shalt no sooner
35843 bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud 'England is
35844 thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet
35845 is thine who though I speak it before his face if he be not
35846 fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good
35847 fellows Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is
35848 music and thy English broken therefore Queen of all Katherine
35849 break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have me
35850 KATHERINE Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere
35851 KING HENRY Nay it will please him well Kate it shall please

35864 cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish
35865 KING HENRY To kiss

35867 KING HENRY It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
35868 before they are married would she say
35869 ALICE Oui vraiment
35870 KING HENRY O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear Kate
35871 you and I cannot be confin'd within the weak list of a country's
35872 fashion we are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that
35873 follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as I will
35874 do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in
35875 denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding [Kissing
35876 her] You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more
35877 eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the
35878 French council and they should sooner persuade Henry of England
35879 than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father
35880 Enter the FRENCH POWER and the ENGLISH LORDS
35881 BURGUNDY God save your Majesty My royal cousin
35882 Teach you our princess English
35883 KING HENRY I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I
35884 love her and that is good English
35885 BURGUNDY Is she not apt
35886 KING HENRY Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
35887 smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of
35888 flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in
35889 her that he will appear in his true likeness
35890 BURGUNDY Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for
35891 that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if
35892 conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked
35893 and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet ros'd over
35894 with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of
35895 a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a
35896 hard condition for a maid to consign to
35897 KING HENRY Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and
35898 enforces
35899 BURGUNDY They are then excus'd my lord when they see not what
35900 they do
35901 KING HENRY Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent
35902 winking
35903 BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach
35904 her to know my meaning for maids well summer'd and warm kept are
35905 like flies at Bartholomewtide blind though they have their
35906 eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not
35907 abide looking on
35908 KING HENRY This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and
35909 so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she
35910 must be blind too
35911 BURGUNDY As love is my lord before it loves
35912 KING HENRY It is so and you may some of you thank love for my
35913 blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair
35914 French maid that stands in my way
35915 FRENCH KING Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
35916 turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls
35917 that war hath never ent'red
35918 KING HENRY Shall Kate be my wife
35919 FRENCH KING So please you
35920 KING HENRY I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait
35921 on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show
35922 me the way to my will
35923 FRENCH KING We have consented to all terms of reason
35924 KING HENRY Is't so my lords of England
35925 WESTMORELAND The king hath granted every article
35926 His daughter first and then in sequel all
35927 According to their firm proposed natures
35928 EXETER Only he hath not yet subscribed this

35934 Haeres Franciae
35935 FRENCH KING Nor this I have not brother so denied
35936 But our request shall make me let it pass
35937 KING HENRY I pray you then in love and dear alliance
35938 Let that one article rank with the rest
35939 And thereupon give me your daughter

35941 Issue to me that the contending kingdoms
35942 Of France and England whose very shores look pale
35943 With envy of each other's happiness
35944 May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
35945 Plant neighbourhood and Christianlike accord
35946 In their sweet bosoms that never war advance
35947 His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France
35948 LORDS Amen
35949 KING HENRY Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all
35950 That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen [Floulish]
35951 QUEEN ISABEL God the best maker of all marriages
35952 Combine your hearts in one your realms in one
35953 As man and wife being two are one in love
35954 So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal
35955 That never may ill office or fell jealousy
35956 Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
35957 Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
35958 To make divorce of their incorporate league
35959 That English may as French French Englishmen
35960 Receive each other God speak this Amen
35961 ALL Amen

36049 SCENE
36050 England and France
36051 The First Part of King Henry the Sixth
36052 ACT I SCENE 1
36053 Westminster Abbey
36054 Dead March Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH
36055 attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD Regent of France
36056 the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER Protector the DUKE OF EXETER
36057 the EARL OF WARWICK the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER
36058 BEDFORD Hung be the heavens with black yield day to
36059 night Comets importing change of times and states
36060 Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
36061 And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
36062 That have consented unto Henry's death
36063 King Henry the Fifth too famous to live long
36064 England ne'er lost a king of so much worth
36065 GLOUCESTER England ne'er had a king until his time
36066 Virtue he had deserving to command
36067 His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams
36068 His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings
36069 His sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire
36070 More dazzled and drove back his enemies
36071 Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces
36072 What should I say His deeds exceed all speech
36073 He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered
36074 EXETER We mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
36075 Henry is dead and never shall revive
36076 Upon a wooden coffin we attend
36077 And death's dishonourable victory
36078 We with our stately presence glorify
36079 Like captives bound to a triumphant car
36080 What shall we curse the planets of mishap
36081 That plotted thus our glory's overthrow
36082 Or shall we think the subtlewitted French
36083 Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
36084 By magic verses have contriv'd his end
36085 WINCHESTER He was a king bless'd of the King of kings
36086 Unto the French the dreadful judgmentday
36087 So dreadful will not be as was his sight
36088 The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought
36089 The Church's prayers made him so prosperous
36090 GLOUCESTER The Church Where is it Had not churchmen
36091 pray'd
36092 His thread of life had not so soon decay'd
36093 None do you like but an effeminate prince
36094 Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe
36095 WINCHESTER Gloucester whate'er we like thou art
36096 Protector
36097 And lookest to command the Prince and realm
36098 Thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe
36099 More than God or religious churchmen may
36100 GLOUCESTER Name not religion for thou lov'st the flesh
36101 And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
36102 Except it be to pray against thy foes
36103 BEDFORD Cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
36104 Let's to the altar Heralds wait on us
36105 Instead of gold we'll offer up our arms
36106 Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead
36107 Posterity await for wretched years
36108 When at their mothers moist'ned eyes babes shall suck
36109 Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears
36110 And none but women left to wail the dead
36111 HENRY the Fifth thy ghost I invocate
36112 Prosper this realm keep it from civil broils
36113 Combat with adverse planets in the heavens
36114 A far more glorious star thy soul will make
36115 Than Julius Caesar or bright
36116 Enter a MESSENGER
36117 MESSENGER My honourable lords health to you all
36118 Sad tidings bring I to you out of France
36119 Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
36120 Guienne Champagne Rheims Orleans
36121 Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lost
36122 BEDFORD What say'st thou man before dead Henry's corse
36123 Speak softly or the loss of those great towns
36124 Will make him burst his lead and rise from death
36125 GLOUCESTER Is Paris lost Is Rouen yielded up
36126 If Henry were recall'd to life again
36127 These news would cause him once more yield the ghost
36128 EXETER How were they lost What treachery was us'd
36129 MESSENGER No treachery but want of men and money
36130 Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
36131 That here you maintain several factions
36132 And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought
36133 You are disputing of your generals
36134 One would have ling'ring wars with little cost
36135 Another would fly swift but wanteth wings
36136 A third thinks without expense at all
36137 By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd
36138 Awake awake English nobility
36139 Let not sloth dim your honours newbegot
36140 Cropp'd are the flowerdeluces in your arms
36141 Of England's coat one half is cut away
36142 EXETER Were our tears wanting to this funeral
36143 These tidings would call forth their flowing tides
36144 BEDFORD Me they concern Regent I am of France
36145 Give me my steeled coat I'll fight for France
36146 Away with these disgraceful wailing robes
36147 Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes
36148 To weep their intermissive miseries
36149 Enter a second MESSENGER
36150 SECOND MESSENGER Lords view these letters full of bad
36151 mischance
36152 France is revolted from the English quite
36153 Except some petty towns of no import
36154 The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims
36155 The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd
36156 Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part
36157 The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side
36158 EXETER The Dauphin crowned king all fly to him
36159 O whither shall we fly from this reproach
36160 GLOUCESTER We will not fly but to our enemies throats
36161 Bedford if thou be slack I'll fight it out
36162 BEDFORD Gloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness
36163 An army have I muster'd in my thoughts
36164 Wherewith already France is overrun
36165 Enter a third MESSENGER
36166 THIRD MESSENGER My gracious lords to add to your
36167 laments
36168 Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse
36169 I must inform you of a dismal fight
36170 Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French
36171 WINCHESTER What Wherein Talbot overcame Is't so
36172 THIRD MESSENGER O no wherein Lord Talbot was
36173 o'erthrown
36174 The circumstance I'll tell you more at large
36175 The tenth of August last this dreadful lord
36176 Retiring from the siege of Orleans
36177 Having full scarce six thousand in his troop
36178 By three and twenty thousand of the French
36179 Was round encompassed and set upon
36180 No leisure had he to enrank his men
36181 He wanted pikes to set before his archers
36182 Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
36183 They pitched in the ground confusedly
36184 To keep the horsemen off from breaking in
36185 More than three hours the fight continued
36186 Where valiant Talbot above human thought
36187 Enacted wonders with his sword and lance
36188 Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
36189 Here there and everywhere enrag'd he slew
36190 The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms
36191 All the whole army stood agaz'd on him
36192 His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
36193 'A Talbot a Talbot cried out amain
36194 And rush'd into the bowels of the battle
36195 Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
36196 If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward
36197 He being in the vaward plac'd behind
36198 With purpose to relieve and follow them
36199 Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
36200 Hence grew the general wreck and massacre
36201 Enclosed were they with their enemies
36202 A base Walloon to win the Dauphin's grace
36203 Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back
36204 Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
36205 Durst not presume to look once in the face
36206 BEDFORD Is Talbot slain Then I will slay myself
36207 For living idly here in pomp and ease
36208 Whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
36209 Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd
36210 THIRD MESSENGER O no he lives but is took prisoner
36211 And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford
36212 Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise
36213 BEDFORD His ransom there is none but I shall pay
36214 I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne
36215 His crown shall be the ransom of my friend
36216 Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours
36217 Farewell my masters to my task will I
36218 Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
36219 To keep our great Saint George's feast withal
36220 Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take
36221 Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake
36222 THIRD MESSENGER So you had need for Orleans is besieg'd
36223 The English army is grown weak and faint
36224 The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
36225 And hardly keeps his men from mutiny
36226 Since they so few watch such a multitude
36227 EXETER Remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn
36228 Either to quell the Dauphin utterly
36229 Or bring him in obedience to your yoke
36230 BEDFORD I do remember it and here take my leave
36231 To go about my preparation Exit
36232 GLOUCESTER I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can
36233 To view th artillery and munition
36234 And then I will proclaim young Henry king Exit
36235 EXETER To Eltham will I where the young King is
36236 Being ordain'd his special governor
36237 And for his safety there I'll best devise Exit
36238 WINCHESTER [Aside] Each hath his place and function to
36239 attend
36240 I am left out for me nothing remains
36241 But long I will not be Jack out of office
36242 The King from Eltham I intend to steal
36243 And sit at chiefest stern of public weal Exeunt
36244 SCENE 2
36245 France Before Orleans
36246 Sound a flourish Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN ALENCON
36247 and REIGNIER marching with drum and soldiers
36248 CHARLES Mars his true moving even as in the heavens
36249 So in the earth to this day is not known
36250 Late did he shine upon the English side
36251 Now we are victors upon us he smiles
36252 What towns of any moment but we have
36253 At pleasure here we lie near Orleans
36254 Otherwhiles the famish'd English like pale ghosts
36255 Faintly besiege us one hour in a month
36256 ALENCON They want their porridge and their fat bull
36257 beeves
36258 Either they must be dieted like mules
36259 And have their provender tied to their mouths
36260 Or piteous they will look like drowned mice
36261 REIGNIER Let's raise the siege Why live we idly here
36262 Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
36263 Remaineth none but madbrain'd Salisbury
36264 And he may well in fretting spend his gall
36265 Nor men nor money hath he to make war
36266 CHARLES Sound sound alarum we will rush on them
36267 Now for the honour of the forlorn French
36268 Him I forgive my death that killeth me
36269 When he sees me go back one foot or flee Exeunt
36270 Here alarum They are beaten hack by the English with
36271 great loss Reenter CHARLES ALENCON and REIGNIER
36272 CHARLES Who ever saw the like What men have I
36273 Dogs cowards dastards I would ne'er have fled
36274 But that they left me midst my enemies
36275 REIGNIER Salisbury is a desperate homicide
36276 He fighteth as one weary of his life
36277 The other lords like lions wanting food
36278 Do rush upon us as their hungry prey
36279 ALENCON Froissart a countryman of ours records
36280 England all Olivers and Rowlands bred
36281 During the time Edward the Third did reign
36282 More truly now may this be verified
36283 For none but Samsons and Goliases
36284 It sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten
36285 Lean rawbon'd rascals Who would e'er suppose
36286 They had such courage and audacity
36287 CHARLES Let's leave this town for they are harebrain'd
36288 slaves
36289 And hunger will enforce them to be more eager
36290 Of old I know them rather with their teeth
36291 The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege
36292 REIGNIER I think by some odd gimmers or device
36293 Their arms are set like clocks still to strike on
36294 Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do
36295 By my consent we'll even let them alone
36296 ALENCON Be it so
36297 Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
36298 BASTARD Where's the Prince Dauphin I have news for him
36299 CHARLES Bastard of Orleans thrice welcome to us
36300 BASTARD Methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd
36301 Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
36302 Be not dismay'd for succour is at hand
36303 A holy maid hither with me I bring
36304 Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
36305 Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
36306 And drive the English forth the bounds of France
36307 The spirit of deep prophecy she hath
36308 Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome
36309 What's past and what's to come she can descry
36310 Speak shall I call her in Believe my words
36311 For they are certain and unfallible
36312 CHARLES Go call her in [Exit BASTARD]
36313 But first to try her skill
36314 Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place
36315 Question her proudly let thy looks be stern
36316 By this means shall we sound what skill she hath
36317 Reenter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with
36318 JOAN LA PUCELLE
36319 REIGNIER Fair maid is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats
36320 PUCELLE Reignier is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me
36321 Where is the Dauphin Come come from behind
36322 I know thee well though never seen before
36323 Be not amaz'd there's nothing hid from me
36324 In private will I talk with thee apart
36325 Stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
36326 REIGNIER She takes upon her bravely at first dash
36327 PUCELLE Dauphin I am by birth a shepherd's daughter
36328 My wit untrain'd in any kind of art
36329 Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd
36330 To shine on my contemptible estate
36331 Lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs
36332 And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks
36333 God's Mother deigned to appear to me
36334 And in a vision full of majesty
36335 Will'd me to leave my base vocation
36336 And free my country from calamity
36337 Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success
36338 In complete glory she reveal'd herself
36339 And whereas I was black and swart before
36340 With those clear rays which she infus'd on me
36341 That beauty am I bless'd with which you may see
36342 Ask me what question thou canst possible
36343 And I will answer unpremeditated
36344 My courage try by combat if thou dar'st
36345 And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex
36346 Resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
36347 If thou receive me for thy warlike mate
36348 CHARLES Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms
36349 Only this proof I'll of thy valour make
36350 In single combat thou shalt buckle with me
36351 And if thou vanquishest thy words are true
36352 Otherwise I renounce all confidence
36353 PUCELLE I am prepar'd here is my keenedg'd sword
36354 Deck'd with five flowerdeluces on each side
36355 The which at Touraine in Saint Katherine's churchyard
36356 Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth
36357 CHARLES Then come o God's name I fear no woman
36358 PUCELLE And while I live I'll ne'er fly from a man
36359 [Here they fight and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes]
36360 CHARLES Stay stay thy hands thou art an Amazon
36361 And fightest with the sword of Deborah
36362 PUCELLE Christ's Mother helps me else I were too weak
36363 CHARLES Whoe'er helps thee 'tis thou that must help me
36364 Impatiently I burn with thy desire
36365 My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd
36366 Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so
36367 Let me thy servant and not sovereign be
36368 'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus
36369 PUCELLE I must not yield to any rites of love
36370 For my profession's sacred from above
36371 When I have chased all thy foes from hence
36372 Then will I think upon a recompense
36373 CHARLES Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
36374 REIGNIER My lord methinks is very long in talk
36375 ALENCON Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
36376 Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech
36377 REIGNIER Shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean
36378 ALENCON He may mean more than we poor men do know
36379 These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
36380 REIGNIER My lord where are you What devise you on
36381 Shall we give o'er Orleans or no
36382 PUCELLE Why no I say distrustful recreants
36383 Fight till the last gasp I will be your guard
36384 CHARLES What she says I'll confirm we'll fight it out
36385 PUCELLE Assign'd am I to be the English scourge
36386 This night the siege assuredly I'll raise
36387 Expect Saint Martin's summer halcyon days
36388 Since I have entered into these wars
36389 Glory is like a circle in the water
36390 Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
36391 Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
36392 With Henry's death the English circle ends
36393 Dispersed are the glories it included
36394 Now am I like that proud insulting ship
36395 Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once
36396 CHARLES Was Mahomet inspired with a dove
36397 Thou with an eagle art inspired then
36398 Helen the mother of great Constantine
36399 Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters were like thee
36400 Bright star of Venus fall'n down on the earth
36401 How may I reverently worship thee enough
36402 ALENCON Leave off delays and let us raise the siege
36403 REIGNIER Woman do what thou canst to save our honours
36404 Drive them from Orleans and be immortaliz'd
36405 CHARLES Presently we'll try Come let's away about it
36406 No prophet will I trust if she prove false Exeunt

36487 Here's Beaufort that regards nor God nor King
36488 Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use
36489 WINCHESTER Here's Gloucester a foe to citizens
36490 One that still motions war and never peace
36491 O'ercharging your free purses with large fines
36492 That seeks to overthrow religion
36493 Because he is Protector of the realm
36494 And would have armour here out of the Tower
36495 To crown himself King and suppress the Prince
36496 GLOUCESTER I Will not answer thee with words but blows

36524 France Before Orleans
36525 Enter on the walls the MASTERGUNNER
36526 OF ORLEANS and his BOY
36527 MASTERGUNNER Sirrah thou know'st how Orleans is
36528 besieg'd
36529 And how the English have the suburbs won
36530 BOY Father I know and oft have shot at them
36531 Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim
36532 MASTERGUNNER But now thou shalt not Be thou rul'd
36533 by me
36534 Chief mastergunner am I of this town
36535 Something I must do to procure me grace
36536 The Prince's espials have informed me
36537 How the English in the suburbs close intrench'd
36538 Wont through a secret grate of iron bars
36539 In yonder tower to overpeer the city
36540 And thence discover how with most advantage
36541 They may vex us with shot or with assault
36542 To intercept this inconvenience
36543 A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd
36544 And even these three days have I watch'd
36545 If I could see them Now do thou watch
36546 For I can stay no longer
36547 If thou spy'st any run and bring me word
36548 And thou shalt find me at the Governor's Exit
36549 BOY Father I warrant you take you no care
36550 I'll never trouble you if I may spy them Exit
36551 Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets with
36552 SIR WILLIAM GLANSDALE SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE
36553 and others
36554 SALISBURY Talbot my life my joy again return'd
36555 How wert thou handled being prisoner
36556 Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd
36557 Discourse I prithee on this turret's top
36558 TALBOT The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner
36559 Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles
36560 For him was I exchang'd and ransomed
36561 But with a baser man of arms by far
36562 Once in contempt they would have barter'd me
36563 Which I disdaining scorn'd and craved death
36564 Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd
36565 In fine redeem'd I was as I desir'd
36566 But O the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart
36567 Whom with my bare fists I would execute
36568 If I now had him brought into my power
36569 SALISBURY Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd
36570 TALBOT With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
36571 In open marketplace produc'd they me
36572 To be a public spectacle to all
36573 Here said they is the terror of the French
36574 The scarecrow that affrights our children so
36575 Then broke I from the officers that led me
36576 And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
36577 To hurl at the beholders of my shame
36578 My grisly countenance made others fly
36579 None durst come near for fear of sudden death
36580 In iron walls they deem'd me not secure
36581 So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
36582 That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel
36583 And spurn in pieces posts of adamant
36584 Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
36585 That walk'd about me every minutewhile
36586 And if I did but stir out of my bed
36587 Ready they were to shoot me to the heart
36588 Enter the BOY with a linstock
36589 SALISBURY I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd
36590 But we will be reveng'd sufficiently
36591 Now it is suppertime in Orleans
36592 Here through this grate I count each one
36593 And view the Frenchmen how they fortify
36594 Let us look in the sight will much delight thee
36595 Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale
36596 Let me have your express opinions
36597 Where is best place to make our batt'ry next
36598 GARGRAVE I think at the North Gate for there stand lords
36599 GLANSDALE And I here at the bulwark of the bridge
36600 TALBOT For aught I see this city must be famish'd
36601 Or with light skirmishes enfeebled
36602 [Here they shoot and SALISBURY and GARGRAVE
36603 fall down]
36604 SALISBURY O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
36605 GARGRAVE O Lord have mercy on me woeful man
36606 TALBOT What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us
36607 Speak Salisbury at least if thou canst speak
36608 How far'st thou mirror of all martial men
36609 One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off
36610 Accursed tower accursed fatal hand
36611 That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy
36612 In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame
36613 Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars
36614 Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
36615 His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field
36616 Yet liv'st thou Salisbury Though thy speech doth fail
36617 One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
36618 The sun with one eye vieweth all the world
36619 Heaven be thou gracious to none alive
36620 If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
36621 Bear hence his body I will help to bury it
36622 Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life
36623 Speak unto Talbot nay look up to him
36624 Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
36625 Thou shalt not die whiles
36626 He beckons with his hand and smiles on me
36627 As who should say 'When I am dead and gone
36628 Remember to avenge me on the French'
36629 Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero
36630 Play on the lute beholding the towns burn
36631 Wretched shall France be only in my name

36639 A holy prophetess new risen up
36640 Is come with a great power to raise the siege
36641 [Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans]
36642 TALBOT Hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan
36643 It irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd
36644 Frenchmen I'll be a Salisbury to you
36645 Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish
36646 Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels

36747 Before Orleans
36748 Enter a FRENCH SERGEANT and two SENTINELS
36749 SERGEANT Sirs take your places and be vigilant
36750 If any noise or soldier you perceive
36751 Near to the walls by some apparent sign
36752 Let us have knowledge at the court of guard
36753 FIRST SENTINEL Sergeant you shall [Exit SERGEANT]
36754 Thus are poor servitors
36755 When others sleep upon their quiet beds
36756 Constrain'd to watch in darkness rain and cold
36757 Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY and forces
36758 with scalingladders their drums beating a dead
36759 march
36760 TALBOT Lord Regent and redoubted Burgundy
36761 By whose approach the regions of Artois
36762 Wallon and Picardy are friends to us
36763 This happy night the Frenchmen are secure
36764 Having all day carous'd and banqueted
36765 Embrace we then this opportunity
36766 As fitting best to quittance their deceit
36767 Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery
36768 BEDFORD Coward of France how much he wrongs his fame
36769 Despairing of his own arm's fortitude
36770 To join with witches and the help of hell
36771 BURGUNDY Traitors have never other company
36772 But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure
36773 TALBOT A maid they say
36774 BEDFORD A maid and be so martial
36775 BURGUNDY Pray God she prove not masculine ere long
36776 If underneath the standard of the French
36777 She carry armour as she hath begun
36778 TALBOT Well let them practise and converse with spirits
36779 God is our fortress in whose conquering name
36780 Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
36781 BEDFORD Ascend brave Talbot we will follow thee
36782 TALBOT Not all together better far I guess
36783 That we do make our entrance several ways
36784 That if it chance the one of us do fail
36785 The other yet may rise against their force
36786 BEDFORD Agreed I'll to yond corner
36787 BURGUNDY And I to this
36788 TALBOT And here will Talbot mount or make his grave
36789 Now Salisbury for thee and for the right
36790 Of English Henry shall this night appear
36791 How much in duty I am bound to both
36792 [The English scale the walls and cry 'Saint George
36793 a Talbot']
36794 SENTINEL Arm arm The enemy doth make assault
36795 The French leap o'er the walls in their shirts
36796 Enter several ways BASTARD ALENCON REIGNIER
36797 half ready and half unready
36798 ALENCON How now my lords What all unready so
36799 BASTARD Unready Ay and glad we 'scap'd so well
36800 REIGNIER 'Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds
36801 Hearing alarums at our chamber doors
36802 ALENCON Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms
36803 Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
36804 More venturous or desperate than this
36805 BASTARD I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell
36806 REIGNIER If not of hell the heavens sure favour him
36807 ALENCON Here cometh Charles I marvel how he sped
36808 Enter CHARLES and LA PUCELLE
36809 BASTARD Tut holy Joan was his defensive guard
36810 CHARLES Is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
36811 Didst thou at first to flatter us withal
36812 Make us partakers of a little gain
36813 That now our loss might be ten times so much
36814 PUCELLE Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend
36815 At all times will you have my power alike
36816 Sleeping or waking must I still prevail
36817 Or will you blame and lay the fault on me
36818 Improvident soldiers Had your watch been good
36819 This sudden mischief never could have fall'n
36820 CHARLES Duke of Alencon this was your default
36821 That being captain of the watch tonight
36822 Did look no better to that weighty charge
36823 ALENCON Had all your quarters been as safely kept
36824 As that whereof I had the government
36825 We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd
36826 BASTARD Mine was secure
36827 REIGNIER And so was mine my lord
36828 CHARLES And for myself most part of all this night
36829 Within her quarter and mine own precinct
36830 I was employ'd in passing to and fro
36831 About relieving of the sentinels
36832 Then how or which way should they first break in
36833 PUCELLE Question my lords no further of the case
36834 How or which way 'tis sure they found some place
36835 But weakly guarded where the breach was made
36836 And now there rests no other shift but this
36837 To gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispers'd
36838 And lay new platforms to endamage them
36839 Alarum Enter an ENGLISH SOLDIER crying
36840 'A Talbot A Talbot They fly leaving their
36841 clothes behind
36842 SOLDIER I'll be so bold to take what they have left
36843 The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword
36844 For I have loaden me with many spoils
36845 Using no other weapon but his name Exit
36846 SCENE 2
36847 ORLEANS Within the town
36848 Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY a CAPTAIN
36849 and others
36850 BEDFORD The day begins to break and night is fled
36851 Whose pitchy mantle overveil'd the earth
36852 Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit
36853 [Retreat sounded]
36854 TALBOT Bring forth the body of old Salisbury
36855 And here advance it in the marketplace
36856 The middle centre of this cursed town
36857 Now have I paid my vow unto his soul
36858 For every drop of blood was drawn from him
36859 There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight
36860 And that hereafter ages may behold
36861 What ruin happened in revenge of him
36862 Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
36863 A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd
36864 Upon the which that every one may read
36865 Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans
36866 The treacherous manner of his mournful death
36867 And what a terror he had been to France
36868 But lords in all our bloody massacre
36869 I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace
36870 His newcome champion virtuous Joan of Arc
36871 Nor any of his false confederates
36872 BEDFORD 'Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began
36873 Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds
36874 They did amongst the troops of armed men
36875 Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field
36876 BURGUNDY Myself as far as I could well discern
36877 For smoke and dusky vapours of the night
36878 Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull
36879 When arm in arm they both came swiftly running
36880 Like to a pair of loving turtledoves
36881 That could not live asunder day or night
36882 After that things are set in order here
36883 We'll follow them with all the power we have
36884 Enter a MESSENGER

36890 With modesty admiring thy renown
36891 By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
36892 To visit her poor castle where she lies
36893 That she may boast she hath beheld the man
36894 Whose glory fills the world with loud report
36895 BURGUNDY Is it even so Nay then I see our wars
36896 Will turn into a peaceful comic sport
36897 When ladies crave to be encount'red with
36898 You may not my lord despise her gentle suit
36899 TALBOT Ne'er trust me then for when a world of men
36900 Could not prevail with all their oratory
36901 Yet hath a woman's kindness overrul'd
36902 And therefore tell her I return great thanks
36903 And in submission will attend on her
36904 Will not your honours bear me company
36905 BEDFORD No truly 'tis more than manners will
36906 And I have heard it said unbidden guests
36907 Are often welcomest when they are gone
36908 TALBOT Well then alone since there's no remedy
36909 I mean to prove this lady's courtesy
36910 Come hither Captain [Whispers] You perceive my mind

36919 I shall as famous be by this exploit
36920 As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus death
36921 Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight
36922 And his achievements of no less account
36923 Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
36924 To give their censure of these rare reports
36925 Enter MESSENGER and TALBOT
36926 MESSENGER Madam according as your ladyship desir'd
36927 By message crav'd so is Lord Talbot come
36928 COUNTESS And he is welcome What is this the man
36929 MESSENGER Madam it is
36930 COUNTESS Is this the scourge of France
36931 Is this Talbot so much fear'd abroad
36932 That with his name the mothers still their babes
36933 I see report is fabulous and false
36934 I thought I should have seen some Hercules
36935 A second Hector for his grim aspect
36936 And large proportion of his strongknit limbs
36937 Alas this is a child a silly dwarf
36938 It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
36939 Should strike such terror to his enemies
36940 TALBOT Madam I have been bold to trouble you
36941 But since your ladyship is not at leisure

36953 And for that cause I train'd thee to my house
36954 Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
36955 For in my gallery thy picture hangs
36956 But now the substance shall endure the like
36957 And I will chain these legs and arms of thine
36958 That hast by tyranny these many years
36959 Wasted our country slain our citizens
36960 And sent our sons and husbands captivate
36961 TALBOT Ha ha ha
36962 COUNTESS Laughest thou wretch Thy mirth shall turn to
36963 moan
36964 TALBOT I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
36965 To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
36966 Whereon to practise your severity
36967 COUNTESS Why art not thou the man
36968 TALBOT I am indeed
36969 COUNTESS Then have I substance too
36970 TALBOT No no I am but shadow of myself
36971 You are deceiv'd my substance is not here
36972 For what you see is but the smallest part
36973 And least proportion of humanity
36974 I tell you madam were the whole frame here
36975 It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
36976 Your roof were not sufficient to contain 't

36982 a peal of ordnance Enter soldiers
36983 How say you madam Are you now persuaded
36984 That Talbot is but shadow of himself
36985 These are his substance sinews arms and strength
36986 With which he yoketh your rebellious necks
36987 Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
36988 And in a moment makes them desolate
36989 COUNTESS Victorious Talbot pardon my abuse
36990 I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
36991 And more than may be gathered by thy shape
36992 Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
36993 For I am sorry that with reverence
36994 I did not entertain thee as thou art
36995 TALBOT Be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconster
36996 The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
36997 The outward composition of his body
36998 What you have done hath not offended me
36999 Nor other satisfaction do I crave
37000 But only with your patience that we may
37001 Taste of your wine and see what cates you have
37002 For soldiers stomachs always serve them well
37003 COUNTESS With all my heart and think me honoured
37004 To feast so great a warrior in my house Exeunt
37005 SCENE 4
37006 London The Temple garden
37007 Enter the EARLS OF SOMERSET SUFFOLK and WARWICK
37008 RICHARD PLANTAGENET VERNON and another LAWYER
37009 PLANTAGENET Great lords and gentlemen what means this
37010 silence
37011 Dare no man answer in a case of truth
37012 SUFFOLK Within the Temple Hall we were too loud
37013 The garden here is more convenient
37014 PLANTAGENET Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth
37015 Or else was wrangling Somerset in th error
37016 SUFFOLK Faith I have been a truant in the law
37017 And never yet could frame my will to it
37018 And therefore frame the law unto my will
37019 SOMERSET Judge you my Lord of Warwick then between us
37020 WARWICK Between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
37021 Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
37022 Between two blades which bears the better temper
37023 Between two horses which doth bear him best
37024 Between two girls which hath the merriest eye
37025 I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment
37026 But in these nice sharp quillets of the law
37027 Good faith I am no wiser than a daw
37028 PLANTAGENET Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
37029 The truth appears so naked on my side
37030 That any purblind eye may find it out
37031 SOMERSET And on my side it is so well apparell'd
37032 So clear so shining and so evident
37033 That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye
37034 PLANTAGENET Since you are tonguetied and so loath to speak
37035 In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
37036 Let him that is a trueborn gentleman
37037 And stands upon the honour of his birth
37038 If he suppose that I have pleaded truth
37039 From off this brier pluck a white rose with me
37040 SOMERSET Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
37041 But dare maintain the party of the truth
37042 Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
37043 WARWICK I love no colours and without all colour
37044 Of base insinuating flattery
37045 I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet
37046 SUFFOLK I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
37047 And say withal I think he held the right
37048 VERNON Stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
37049 Till you conclude that he upon whose side
37050 The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
37051 Shall yield the other in the right opinion
37052 SOMERSET Good Master Vernon it is well objected
37053 If I have fewest I subscribe in silence
37054 PLANTAGENET And I
37055 VERNON Then for the truth and plainness of the case
37056 I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
37057 Giving my verdict on the white rose side
37058 SOMERSET Prick not your finger as you pluck it off
37059 Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
37060 And fall on my side so against your will
37061 VERNON If I my lord for my opinion bleed
37062 Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
37063 And keep me on the side where still I am
37064 SOMERSET Well well come on who else
37065 LAWYER [To Somerset] Unless my study and my books be
37066 false
37067 The argument you held was wrong in you
37068 In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too
37069 PLANTAGENET Now Somerset where is your argument
37070 SOMERSET Here in my scabbard meditating that
37071 Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
37072 PLANTAGENET Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
37073 roses
37074 For pale they look with fear as witnessing
37075 The truth on our side
37076 SOMERSET No Plantagenet
37077 'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
37078 Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
37079 And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
37080 PLANTAGENET Hath not thy rose a canker Somerset
37081 SOMERSET Hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet
37082 PLANTAGENET Ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
37083 Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
37084 SOMERSET Well I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses
37085 That shall maintain what I have said is true
37086 Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen
37087 PLANTAGENET Now by this maiden blossom in my hand
37088 I scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
37089 SUFFOLK Turn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet
37090 PLANTAGENET Proud Pole I will and scorn both him and
37091 thee
37092 SUFFOLK I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat
37093 SOMERSET Away away good William de la Pole
37094 We grace the yeoman by conversing with him
37095 WARWICK Now by God's will thou wrong'st him Somerset
37096 His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence
37097 Third son to the third Edward King of England
37098 Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
37099 PLANTAGENET He bears him on the place's privilege
37100 Or durst not for his craven heart say thus
37101 SOMERSET By Him that made me I'll maintain my words
37102 On any plot of ground in Christendom
37103 Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge
37104 For treason executed in our late king's days
37105 And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted
37106 Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
37107 His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
37108 And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman
37109 PLANTAGENET My father was attached not attainted
37110 Condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor
37111 And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset
37112 Were growing time once ripened to my will
37113 For your partaker Pole and you yourself
37114 I'll note you in my book of memory
37115 To scourge you for this apprehension
37116 Look to it well and say you are well warn'd
37117 SOMERSET Ay thou shalt find us ready for thee still
37118 And know us by these colours for thy foes
37119 For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
37120 PLANTAGENET And by my soul this pale and angry rose
37121 As cognizance of my blooddrinking hate
37122 Will I for ever and my faction wear
37123 Until it wither with me to my grave
37124 Or flourish to the height of my degree
37125 SUFFOLK Go forward and be chok'd with thy ambition
37126 And so farewell until I meet thee next Exit
37127 SOMERSET Have with thee Pole Farewell ambitious
37128 Richard Exit
37129 PLANTAGENET How I am brav'd and must perforce endure
37130 it
37131 WARWICK This blot that they object against your house
37132 Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament
37133 Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester
37134 And if thou be not then created York
37135 I will not live to be accounted Warwick
37136 Meantime in signal of my love to thee
37137 Against proud Somerset and William Pole
37138 Will I upon thy party wear this rose
37139 And here I prophesy this brawl today
37140 Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden
37141 Shall send between the Red Rose and the White
37142 A thousand souls to death and deadly night
37143 PLANTAGENET Good Master Vernon I am bound to you
37144 That you on my behalf would pluck a flower
37145 VERNON In your behalf still will I wear the same
37146 LAWYER And so will I
37147 PLANTAGENET Thanks gentle sir
37148 Come let us four to dinner I dare say
37149 This quarrel will drink blood another day Exeunt
37150 SCENE 5
37151 The Tower of London
37152 Enter MORTIMER brought in a chair and GAOLERS
37153 MORTIMER Kind keepers of my weak decaying age
37154 Let dying Mortimer here rest himself
37155 Even like a man new haled from the rack
37156 So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
37157 And these grey locks the pursuivants of death
37158 Nestorlike aged in an age of care
37159 Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer
37160 These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
37161 Wax dim as drawing to their exigent
37162 Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief
37163 And pithless arms like to a withered vine
37164 That droops his sapless branches to the ground
37165 Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
37166 Unable to support this lump of clay
37167 Swiftwinged with desire to get a grave
37168 As witting I no other comfort have
37169 But tell me keeper will my nephew come
37170 FIRST KEEPER Richard Plantagenet my lord will come
37171 We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber
37172 And answer was return'd that he will come
37173 MORTIMER Enough my soul shall then be satisfied
37174 Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
37175 Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign
37176 Before whose glory I was great in arms
37177 This loathsome sequestration have I had
37178 And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd
37179 Depriv'd of honour and inheritance
37180 But now the arbitrator of despairs
37181 Just Death kind umpire of men's miseries
37182 With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
37183 I would his troubles likewise were expir'd
37184 That so he might recover what was lost
37185 Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
37186 FIRST KEEPER My lord your loving nephew now is come
37187 MORTIMER Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come
37188 PLANTAGENET Ay noble uncle thus ignobly us'd
37189 Your nephew late despised Richard comes
37190 MORTIMER Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
37191 And in his bosom spend my latter gasp
37192 O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
37193 That I may kindly give one fainting kiss
37194 And now declare sweet stem from York's great stock
37195 Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd
37196 PLANTAGENET First lean thine aged back against mine arm
37197 And in that ease I'll tell thee my disease
37198 This day in argument upon a case
37199 Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me
37200 Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
37201 And did upbraid me with my father's death
37202 Which obloquy set bars before my tongue
37203 Else with the like I had requited him
37204 Therefore good uncle for my father's sake
37205 In honour of a true Plantagenet
37206 And for alliance sake declare the cause
37207 My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head
37208 MORTIMER That cause fair nephew that imprison'd me
37209 And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth
37210 Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
37211 Was cursed instrument of his decease
37212 PLANTAGENET Discover more at large what cause that was
37213 For I am ignorant and cannot guess
37214 MORTIMER I will if that my fading breath permit
37215 And death approach not ere my tale be done
37216 Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king
37217 Depos'd his nephew Richard Edward's son
37218 The firstbegotten and the lawful heir
37219 Of Edward king the third of that descent
37220 During whose reign the Percies of the north
37221 Finding his usurpation most unjust
37222 Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne
37223 The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
37224 Was for thatyoung Richard thus remov'd
37225 Leaving no heir begotten of his body
37226 I was the next by birth and parentage
37227 For by my mother I derived am
37228 From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son
37229 To King Edward the Third whereas he
37230 From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree
37231 Being but fourth of that heroic line
37232 But mark as in this haughty great attempt
37233 They laboured to plant the rightful heir
37234 I lost my liberty and they their lives
37235 Long after this when Henry the Fifth
37236 Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign
37237 Thy father Earl of Cambridge then deriv'd
37238 From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York
37239 Marrying my sister that thy mother was
37240 Again in pity of my hard distress
37241 Levied an army weening to redeem
37242 And have install'd me in the diadem
37243 But as the rest so fell that noble earl
37244 And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers
37245 In whom the title rested were suppress'd
37246 PLANTAGENET Of Which my lord your honour is the last
37247 MORTIMER True and thou seest that I no issue have
37248 And that my fainting words do warrant death
37249 Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather
37250 But yet be wary in thy studious care
37251 PLANTAGENET Thy grave admonishments prevail with me
37252 But yet methinks my father's execution
37253 Was nothing less than bloody tyranny
37254 MORTIMER With silence nephew be thou politic
37255 Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster
37256 And like a mountain not to be remov'd
37257 But now thy uncle is removing hence
37258 As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
37259 With long continuance in a settled place
37260 PLANTAGENET O uncle would some part of my young years
37261 Might but redeem the passage of your age
37262 MORTIMER Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer
37263 doth
37264 Which giveth many wounds when one will kill
37265 Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
37266 Only give order for my funeral
37267 And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
37268 And prosperous be thy life in peace and war [Dies]
37269 PLANTAGENET And peace no war befall thy parting soul
37270 In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
37271 And like a hermit overpass'd thy days
37272 Well I will lock his counsel in my breast
37273 And what I do imagine let that rest
37274 Keepers convey him hence and I myself
37275 Will see his burial better than his life
37276 Exeunt GAOLERS hearing out the body of MORTIMER
37277 Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer
37278 Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort
37279 And for those wrongs those bitter injuries
37280 Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house
37281 I doubt not but with honour to redress
37282 And therefore haste I to the Parliament
37283 Either to be restored to my blood
37284 Or make my ill th advantage of my good Exit

37293 ACT III SCENE 1
37294 London The Parliament House
37295 Flourish Enter the KING EXETER GLOUCESTER WARWICK SOMERSET and SUFFOLK
37296 the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER RICHARD PLANTAGENET and others
37297 GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill WINCHESTER snatches it and tears it
37298 WINCHESTER Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines
37299 With written pamphlets studiously devis'd
37300 Humphrey of Gloucester if thou canst accuse
37301 Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge
37302 Do it without invention suddenly
37303 I with sudden and extemporal speech
37304 Purpose to answer what thou canst object
37305 GLOUCESTER Presumptuous priest this place commands my
37306 patience
37307 Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me
37308 Think not although in writing I preferr'd
37309 The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
37310 That therefore I have forg'd or am not able
37311 Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
37312 No prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
37313 Thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
37314 As very infants prattle of thy pride
37315 Thou art a most pernicious usurer
37316 Froward by nature enemy to peace
37317 Lascivious wanton more than well beseems
37318 A man of thy profession and degree
37319 And for thy treachery what's more manifest
37320 In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
37321 As well at London Bridge as at the Tower
37322 Beside I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
37323 The King thy sovereign is not quite exempt
37324 From envious malice of thy swelling heart
37325 WINCHESTER Gloucester I do defy thee Lords vouchsafe
37326 To give me hearing what I shall reply
37327 If I were covetous ambitious or perverse
37328 As he will have me how am I so poor
37329 Or how haps it I seek not to advance
37330 Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
37331 And for dissension who preferreth peace
37332 More than I do except I be provok'd
37333 No my good lords it is not that offends
37334 It is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the Duke
37335 It is because no one should sway but he
37336 No one but he should be about the King
37337 And that engenders thunder in his breast
37338 And makes him roar these accusations forth
37339 But he shall know I am as good
37340 GLOUCESTER As good
37341 Thou bastard of my grandfather
37342 WINCHESTER Ay lordly sir for what are you I pray
37343 But one imperious in another's throne
37344 GLOUCESTER Am I not Protector saucy priest
37345 WINCHESTER And am not I a prelate of the church
37346 GLOUCESTER Yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
37347 And useth it to patronage his theft
37348 WINCHESTER Unreverent Gloucester
37349 GLOUCESTER Thou art reverend
37350 Touching thy spiritual function not thy life
37351 WINCHESTER Rome shall remedy this
37352 WARWICK Roam thither then
37353 SOMERSET My lord it were your duty to forbear
37354 WARWICK Ay see the bishop be not overborne
37355 SOMERSET Methinks my lord should be religious
37356 And know the office that belongs to such
37357 WARWICK Methinks his lordship should be humbler
37358 It fitteth not a prelate so to plead
37359 SOMERSET Yes when his holy state is touch'd so near
37360 WARWICK State holy or unhallow'd what of that
37361 Is not his Grace Protector to the King
37362 PLANTAGENET [Aside] Plantagenet I see must hold his
37363 tongue
37364 Lest it be said 'Speak sirrah when you should
37365 Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords'
37366 Else would I have a fling at Winchester
37367 KING HENRY Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester
37368 The special watchmen of our English weal
37369 I would prevail if prayers might prevail
37370 To join your hearts in love and amity
37371 O what a scandal is it to our crown
37372 That two such noble peers as ye should jar
37373 Believe me lords my tender years can tell
37374 Civil dissension is a viperous worm
37375 That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
37376 [A noise within 'Down with the tawny coats']
37377 What tumult's this
37378 WARWICK An uproar I dare warrant
37379 Begun through malice of the Bishop's men
37380 [A noise again 'Stones Stones']
37381 Enter the MAYOR OF LONDON attended
37382 MAYOR O my good lords and virtuous Henry
37383 Pity the city of London pity us
37384 The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men
37385 Forbidden late to carry any weapon
37386 Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
37387 And banding themselves in contrary parts
37388 Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
37389 That many have their giddy brains knock'd out
37390 Our windows are broke down in every street
37391 And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops
37392 Enter in skirmish the retainers of GLOUCESTER and
37393 WINCHESTER with bloody pates
37394 KING HENRY We charge you on allegiance to ourself
37395 To hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace
37396 Pray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife
37397 FIRST SERVINGMAN Nay if we be forbidden stones we'll
37398 fall to it with our teeth
37399 SECOND SERVINGMAN Do what ye dare we are as resolute
37400 [Skirmish again]
37401 GLOUCESTER You of my household leave this peevish broil
37402 And set this unaccustom'd fight aside
37403 THIRD SERVINGMAN My lord we know your Grace to be a
37404 man
37405 Just and upright and for your royal birth
37406 Inferior to none but to his Majesty
37407 And ere that we will suffer such a prince
37408 So kind a father of the commonweal
37409 To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
37410 We and our wives and children all will fight
37411 And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes
37412 FIRST SERVINGMAN Ay and the very parings of our nails
37413 Shall pitch a field when we are dead [Begin again]
37414 GLOUCESTER Stay stay I say
37415 And if you love me as you say you do
37416 Let me persuade you to forbear awhile
37417 KING HENRY O how this discord doth afflict my soul
37418 Can you my Lord of Winchester behold
37419 My sighs and tears and will not once relent
37420 Who should be pitiful if you be not
37421 Or who should study to prefer a peace
37422 If holy churchmen take delight in broils
37423 WARWICK Yield my Lord Protector yield Winchester
37424 Except you mean with obstinate repulse
37425 To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
37426 You see what mischief and what murder too
37427 Hath been enacted through your enmity
37428 Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
37429 WINCHESTER He shall submit or I will never yield
37430 GLOUCESTER Compassion on the King commands me stoop
37431 Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
37432 Should ever get that privilege of me
37433 WARWICK Behold my Lord of Winchester the Duke
37434 Hath banish'd moody discontented fury
37435 As by his smoothed brows it doth appear
37436 Why look you still so stem and tragical
37437 GLOUCESTER Here Winchester I offer thee my hand
37438 KING HENRY Fie uncle Beaufort I have heard you preach
37439 That malice was a great and grievous sin
37440 And will not you maintain the thing you teach
37441 But prove a chief offender in the same
37442 WARWICK Sweet King The Bishop hath a kindly gird
37443 For shame my Lord of Winchester relent
37444 What shall a child instruct you what to do
37445 WINCHESTER Well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee
37446 Love for thy love and hand for hand I give
37447 GLOUCESTER [Aside] Ay but I fear me with a hollow
37448 heart
37449 See here my friends and loving countrymen
37450 This token serveth for a flag of truce
37451 Betwixt ourselves and all our followers
37452 So help me God as I dissemble not
37453 WINCHESTER [Aside] So help me God as I intend it not
37454 KING HENRY O loving uncle kind Duke of Gloucester
37455 How joyful am I made by this contract
37456 Away my masters trouble us no more
37457 But join in friendship as your lords have done
37458 FIRST SERVINGMAN Content I'll to the surgeon's
37459 SECOND SERVINGMAN And so will I

37461 affords Exeunt servants MAYOR &C
37462 WARWICK Accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
37463 Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
37464 We do exhibit to your Majesty
37465 GLOUCESTER Well urg'd my Lord of Warwick for sweet
37466 prince
37467 An if your Grace mark every circumstance
37468 You have great reason to do Richard right
37469 Especially for those occasions
37470 At Eltham Place I told your Majesty
37471 KING HENRY And those occasions uncle were of force
37472 Therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
37473 That Richard be restored to his blood
37474 WARWICK Let Richard be restored to his blood
37475 So shall his father's wrongs be recompens'd
37476 WINCHESTER As will the rest so willeth Winchester
37477 KING HENRY If Richard will be true not that alone
37478 But all the whole inheritance I give
37479 That doth belong unto the house of York
37480 From whence you spring by lineal descent
37481 PLANTAGENET Thy humble servant vows obedience
37482 And humble service till the point of death
37483 KING HENRY Stoop then and set your knee against my foot
37484 And in reguerdon of that duty done
37485 I girt thee with the valiant sword of York
37486 Rise Richard like a true Plantagenet
37487 And rise created princely Duke of York
37488 PLANTAGENET And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall
37489 And as my duty springs so perish they
37490 That grudge one thought against your Majesty
37491 ALL Welcome high Prince the mighty Duke of York
37492 SOMERSET [Aside] Perish base Prince ignoble Duke of
37493 York
37494 GLOUCESTER Now will it best avail your Majesty
37495 To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France
37496 The presence of a king engenders love
37497 Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
37498 As it disanimates his enemies
37499 KING HENRY When Gloucester says the word King Henry
37500 goes
37501 For friendly counsel cuts off many foes
37502 GLOUCESTER Your ships already are in readiness
37503 Sennet Flourish Exeunt all but EXETER
37504 EXETER Ay we may march in England or in France
37505 Not seeing what is likely to ensue
37506 This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
37507 Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love
37508 And will at last break out into a flame
37509 As fest'red members rot but by degree
37510 Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
37511 So will this base and envious discord breed
37512 And now I fear that fatal prophecy
37513 Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth
37514 Was in the mouth of every sucking babe
37515 That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
37516 And Henry born at Windsor should lose all
37517 Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
37518 His days may finish ere that hapless time Exit

37740 See see the pining malady of France
37741 Behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
37742 Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast

37757 Who then but English Henry will be lord
37758 And thou be thrust out like a fugitive
37759 Call we to mindand mark but this for proof
37760 Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe
37761 And was he not in England prisoner
37762 But when they heard he was thine enemy

37764 In spite of Burgundy and all his friends

37853 [GOVERNOR kneels]
37854 That you elect no other king but him
37855 Esteem none friends but such as are his friends
37856 And none your foes but such as shall pretend
37857 Malicious practices against his state

37861 FASTOLFE My gracious sovereign as I rode from Calais
37862 To haste unto your coronation
37863 A letter was deliver'd to my hands
37864 Writ to your Grace from th Duke of Burgundy
37865 TALBOT Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee
37866 I vow'd base knight when I did meet thee next
37867 To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg [Plucking it off]
37868 Which I have done because unworthily
37869 Thou wast installed in that high degree
37870 Pardon me princely Henry and the rest
37871 This dastard at the battle of Patay
37872 When but in all I was six thousand strong
37873 And that the French were almost ten to one
37874 Before we met or that a stroke was given
37875 Like to a trusty squire did run away
37876 In which assault we lost twelve hundred men
37877 Myself and divers gentlemen beside
37878 Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners
37879 Then judge great lords if I have done amiss
37880 Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
37881 This ornament of knighthoodyea or no
37882 GLOUCESTER To say the truth this fact was infamous
37883 And ill beseeming any common man
37884 Much more a knight a captain and a leader
37885 TALBOT When first this order was ordain'd my lords
37886 Knights of the Garter were of noble birth
37887 Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
37888 Such as were grown to credit by the wars
37889 Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
37890 But always resolute in most extremes
37891 He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
37892 Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
37893 Profaning this most honourable order
37894 And should if I were worthy to be judge
37895 Be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain
37896 That doth presume to boast of gentle blood
37897 KING HENRY Stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy
37898 doom

37905 Grace that he hath chang'd his style
37906 No more but plain and bluntly 'To the King'
37907 Hath he forgot he is his sovereign
37908 Or doth this churlish superscription
37909 Pretend some alteration in goodwill
37910 What's here [Reads] 'I have upon especial cause
37911 Mov'd with compassion of my country's wreck
37912 Together with the pitiful complaints
37913 Of such as your oppression feeds upon
37914 Forsaken your pernicious faction
37915 And join'd with Charles the rightful King of France'
37916 O monstrous treachery Can this be so
37917 That in alliance amity and oaths
37918 There should be found such false dissembling guile
37919 KING HENRY What Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt
37920 GLOUCESTER He doth my lord and is become your foe
37921 KING HENRY Is that the worst this letter doth contain
37922 GLOUCESTER It is the worst and all my lord he writes
37923 KING HENRY Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with
37924 him
37925 And give him chastisement for this abuse
37926 How say you my lord are you not content
37927 TALBOT Content my liege Yes but that I am prevented
37928 I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd
37929 KING HENRY Then gather strength and march unto him
37930 straight
37931 Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
37932 And what offence it is to flout his friends
37933 TALBOT I go my lord in heart desiring still
37934 You may behold confusion of your foes Exit

37940 KING HENRY Be patient lords and give them leave to speak
37941 Say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
37942 And wherefore crave you combat or with whom
37943 VERNON With him my lord for he hath done me wrong
37944 BASSET And I with him for he hath done me wrong
37945 KING HENRY What is that wrong whereof you both
37946 complain First let me know and then I'll answer you
37947 BASSET Crossing the sea from England into France
37948 This fellow here with envious carping tongue
37949 Upbraided me about the rose I wear
37950 Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
37951 Did represent my master's blushing cheeks
37952 When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
37953 About a certain question in the law
37954 Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him
37955 With other vile and ignominious terms
37956 In confutation of which rude reproach
37957 And in defence of my lord's worthiness
37958 I crave the benefit of law of arms
37959 VERNON And that is my petition noble lord
37960 For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
37961 To set a gloss upon his bold intent
37962 Yet know my lord I was provok'd by him
37963 And he first took exceptions at this badge
37964 Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
37965 Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart
37966 YORK Will not this malice Somerset be left
37967 SOMERSET Your private grudge my Lord of York will out
37968 Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it
37969 KING HENRY Good Lord what madness rules in brainsick
37970 men When for so slight and frivolous a cause
37971 Such factious emulations shall arise
37972 Good cousins both of York and Somerset
37973 Quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace
37974 YORK Let this dissension first be tried by fight
37975 And then your Highness shall command a peace
37976 SOMERSET The quarrel toucheth none but us alone
37977 Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
37978 YORK There is my pledge accept it Somerset
37979 VERNON Nay let it rest where it began at first
37980 BASSET Confirm it so mine honourable lord
37981 GLOUCESTER Confirm it so Confounded be your strife
37982 And perish ye with your audacious prate
37983 Presumptuous vassals are you not asham'd
37984 With this immodest clamorous outrage
37985 To trouble and disturb the King and us
37986 And you my lords methinks you do not well
37987 To bear with their perverse objections
37988 Much less to take occasion from their mouths
37989 To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
37990 Let me persuade you take a better course
37991 EXETER It grieves his Highness Good my lords be friends
37992 KING HENRY Come hither you that would be combatants
37993 Henceforth I charge you as you love our favour
37994 Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
37995 And you my lords remember where we are
37996 In France amongst a fickle wavering nation
37997 If they perceive dissension in our looks
37998 And that within ourselves we disagree
37999 How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd
38000 To wilful disobedience and rebel
38001 Beside what infamy will there arise
38002 When foreign princes shall be certified
38003 That for a toy a thing of no regard
38004 King Henry's peers and chief nobility
38005 Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France
38006 O think upon the conquest of my father
38007 My tender years and let us not forgo
38008 That for a trifle that was bought with blood
38009 Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
38010 I see no reason if I wear this rose
38011 [Putting on a red rose]
38012 That any one should therefore be suspicious
38013 I more incline to Somerset than York
38014 Both are my kinsmen and I love them both
38015 As well they may upbraid me with my crown
38016 Because forsooth the King of Scots is crown'd
38017 But your discretions better can persuade
38018 Than I am able to instruct or teach
38019 And therefore as we hither came in peace
38020 So let us still continue peace and love
38021 Cousin of York we institute your Grace
38022 To be our Regent in these parts of France
38023 And good my Lord of Somerset unite
38024 Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
38025 And like true subjects sons of your progenitors
38026 Go cheerfully together and digest
38027 Your angry choler on your enemies
38028 Ourself my Lord Protector and the rest
38029 After some respite will return to Calais
38030 From thence to England where I hope ere long
38031 To be presented by your victories
38032 With Charles Alencon and that traitorous rout

38034 EXETER VERNON
38035 WARWICK My Lord of York I promise you the King
38036 Prettily methought did play the orator
38037 YORK And so he did but yet I like it not
38038 In that he wears the badge of Somerset
38039 WARWICK Tush that was but his fancy blame him not
38040 I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
38041 YORK An if I wist he didbut let it rest
38042 Other affairs must now be managed
38043 Exeunt all but EXETER
38044 EXETER Well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice
38045 For had the passions of thy heart burst out
38046 I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
38047 More rancorous spite more furious raging broils
38048 Than yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd
38049 But howsoe'er no simple man that sees
38050 This jarring discord of nobility
38051 This shouldering of each other in the court
38052 This factious bandying of their favourites
38053 But that it doth presage some ill event
38054 'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands
38055 But more when envy breeds unkind division
38056 There comes the ruin there begins confusion Exit

38068 And do him homage as obedient subjects
38069 And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power
38070 But if you frown upon this proffer'd peace
38071 You tempt the fury of my three attendants
38072 Lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire
38073 Who in a moment even with the earth
38074 Shall lay your stately and air braving towers
38075 If you forsake the offer of their love
38076 GENERAL OF THE FRENCH Thou ominous and fearful owl of
38077 death
38078 Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge
38079 The period of thy tyranny approacheth
38080 On us thou canst not enter but by death
38081 For I protest we are well fortified
38082 And strong enough to issue out and fight
38083 If thou retire the Dauphin well appointed
38084 Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
38085 On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd
38086 To wall thee from the liberty of flight
38087 And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
38088 But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
38089 And pale destruction meets thee in the face
38090 Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
38091 To rive their dangerous artillery
38092 Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot
38093 Lo there thou stand'st a breathing valiant man
38094 Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit

38103 Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul
38104 And mine shall ring thy dire departure out Exit
38105 TALBOT He fables not I hear the enemy
38106 Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
38107 O negligent and heedless discipline
38108 How are we park'd and bounded in a pale
38109 A little herd of England's timorous deer
38110 Maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs
38111 If we be English deer be then in blood
38112 Not rascallike to fall down with a pinch
38113 But rather moodymad and desperate stags
38114 Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
38115 And make the cowards stand aloof at bay
38116 Sell every man his life as dear as mine

38134 That thus delays my promised supply
38135 Of horsemen that were levied for this siege
38136 Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid
38137 And I am louted by a traitor villain

38161 I met in travel toward his warlike father
38162 This seven years did not Talbot see his son
38163 And now they meet where both their lives are done
38164 YORK Alas what joy shall noble Talbot have
38165 To bid his young son welcome to his grave
38166 Away vexation almost stops my breath

38235 To tutor thee in stratagems of war
38236 That Talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
38237 When sapless age and weak unable limbs
38238 Should bring thy father to his drooping chair
38239 But O malignant and illboding stars
38240 Now thou art come unto a feast of death
38241 A terrible and unavoided danger
38242 Therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
38243 And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
38244 By sudden flight Come dally not be gone
38245 JOHN Is my name Talbot and am I your son
38246 And shall I fly O if you love my mother
38247 Dishonour not her honourable name
38248 To make a bastard and a slave of me
38249 The world will say he is not Talbot's blood
38250 That basely fled when noble Talbot stood
38251 TALBOT Fly to revenge my death if I be slain
38252 JOHN He that flies so will ne'er return again
38253 TALBOT If we both stay we both are sure to die
38254 JOHN Then let me stay and father do you fly
38255 Your loss is great so your regard should be
38256 My worth unknown no loss is known in me
38257 Upon my death the French can little boast
38258 In yours they will in you all hopes are lost
38259 Flight cannot stain the honour you have won
38260 But mine it will that no exploit have done
38261 You fled for vantage every one will swear
38262 But if I bow they'll say it was for fear
38263 There is no hope that ever I will stay
38264 If the first hour I shrink and run away
38265 Here on my knee I beg mortality
38266 Rather than life preserv'd with infamy
38267 TALBOT Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb
38268 JOHN Ay rather than I'll shame my mother's womb
38269 TALBOT Upon my blessing I command thee go
38270 JOHN To fight I will but not to fly the foe
38271 TALBOT Part of thy father may be sav'd in thee
38272 JOHN No part of him but will be shame in me
38273 TALBOT Thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
38274 JOHN Yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
38275 TALBOT Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain
38276 JOHN You cannot witness for me being slain
38277 If death be so apparent then both fly
38278 TALBOT And leave my followers here to fight and die
38279 My age was never tainted with such shame
38280 JOHN And shall my youth be guilty of such blame
38281 No more can I be severed from your side
38282 Than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide
38283 Stay go do what you will the like do I
38284 For live I will not if my father die
38285 TALBOT Then here I take my leave of thee fair son

38298 JOHN O twice my father twice am I thy son
38299 The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done
38300 Till with thy warlike sword despite of fate
38301 To my determin'd time thou gav'st new date
38302 TALBOT When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck
38303 fire

38305 Of boldfac'd victory Then leaden age
38306 Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage
38307 Beat down Alencon Orleans Burgundy
38308 And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee
38309 The ireful bastard Orleans that drew blood
38310 From thee my boy and had the maidenhood
38311 Of thy first fight I soon encountered
38312 And interchanging blows I quickly shed
38313 Some of his bastard blood and in disgrace
38314 Bespoke him thus 'Contaminated base
38315 And misbegotten blood I spill of thine
38316 Mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine
38317 Which thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy'
38318 Here purposing the Bastard to destroy
38319 Came in strong rescue Speak thy father's care
38320 Art thou not weary John How dost thou fare
38321 Wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly
38322 Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry
38323 Fly to revenge my death when I am dead
38324 The help of one stands me in little stead
38325 O too much folly is it well I wot
38326 To hazard all our lives in one small boat
38327 If I today die not with Frenchmen's rage
38328 Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age
38329 By me they nothing gain an if I stay
38330 'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day
38331 In thee thy mother dies our household's name
38332 My death's revenge thy youth and England's fame
38333 All these and more we hazard by thy stay
38334 All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away
38335 JOHN The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart
38336 These words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart
38337 On that advantage bought with such a shame
38338 To save a paltry life and slay bright fame
38339 Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly
38340 The coward horse that bears me fall and die
38341 And like me to the peasant boys of France
38342 To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance
38343 Surely by all the glory you have won
38344 An if I fly I am not Talbot's son
38345 Then talk no more of flight it is no boot
38346 If son to Talbot die at Talbot's foot
38347 TALBOT Then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete

38359 His bloody sword he brandish'd over me
38360 And like a hungry lion did commence
38361 Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience
38362 But when my angry guardant stood alone
38363 Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none
38364 Dizzyey'd fury and great rage of heart
38365 Suddenly made him from my side to start
38366 Into the clust'ring battle of the French

38393 PUCELLE Once I encount'red him and thus I said
38394 'Thou maiden youth be vanquish'd by a maid'
38395 But with a proud majestical high scorn
38396 He answer'd thus 'Young Talbot was not born
38397 To be the pillage of a giglot wench'

38433 Him that thou magnifi'st with all these tides

38444 And give them burial as beseems their worth
38445 PUCELLE I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost
38446 He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
38447 For God's sake let him have them to keep them here
38448 They would but stink and putrefy the air
38449 CHARLES Go take their bodies hence
38450 LUCY I'll bear them hence but from their ashes shall be
38451 rear'd
38452 A phoenix that shall make all France afeard

38454 wilt
38455 And now to Paris in this conquering vein
38456 All will be ours now bloody Talbot's slain Exeunt

38629 SUFFOLK An earl I am and Suffolk am I call'd
38630 Be not offended nature's miracle
38631 Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me
38632 So doth the swan her downy cygnets save

38636 O stay [Aside] I have no power to let her pass
38637 My hand would free her but my heart says no

38671 SUFFOLK [Aside] Yet so my fancy may be satisfied
38672 And peace established between these realms
38673 But there remains a scruple in that too
38674 For though her father be the King of Naples
38675 Duke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor

38692 SUFFOLK Say gentle Princess would you not suppose
38693 Your bondage happy to be made a queen
38694 MARGARET To be a queen in bondage is more vile
38695 Than is a slave in base servility
38696 For princes should be free
38697 SUFFOLK And so shall you
38698 If happy England's royal king be free
38699 MARGARET Why what concerns his freedom unto me
38700 SUFFOLK I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen

38784 And natural graces that extinguish art

38917 By sight of these our baleful enemies
38918 CARDINAL Charles and the rest it is enacted thus
38919 That in regard King Henry gives consent
38920 Of mere compassion and of lenity
38921 To ease your country of distressful war
38922 An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
38923 You shall become true liegemen to his crown
38924 And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear
38925 To pay him tribute and submit thyself
38926 Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him
38927 And still enjoy thy regal dignity
38928 ALENCON Must he be then as shadow of himself
38929 Adorn his temples with a coronet
38930 And yet in substance and authority
38931 Retain but privilege of a private man
38932 This proffer is absurd and reasonless
38933 CHARLES 'Tis known already that I am possess'd
38934 With more than half the Gallian territories
38935 And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king
38936 Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd
38937 Detract so much from that prerogative
38938 As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole
38939 No Lord Ambassador I'll rather keep
38940 That which I have than coveting for more
38941 Be cast from possibility of all
38942 YORK Insulting Charles Hast thou by secret means
38943 Us'd intercession to obtain a league
38944 And now the matter grows to compromise
38945 Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison
38946 Either accept the title thou usurp'st
38947 Of benefit proceeding from our king
38948 And not of any challenge of desert
38949 Or we will plague thee with incessant wars
38950 REIGNIER [To CHARLES] My lord you do not well in
38951 obstinacy
38952 To cavil in the course of this contract
38953 If once it be neglected ten to one
38954 We shall not find like opportunity
38955 ALENCON [To CHARLES] To say the truth it is your policy
38956 To save your subjects from such massacre
38957 And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
38958 By our proceeding in hostility
38959 And therefore take this compact of a truce
38960 Although you break it when your pleasure serves
38961 WARWICK How say'st thou Charles Shall our condition
38962 stand
38963 CHARLES It shall
38964 Only reserv'd you claim no interest
38965 In any of our towns of garrison
38966 YORK Then swear allegiance to his Majesty
38967 As thou art knight never to disobey
38968 Nor be rebellious to the crown of England
38969 Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England
38970 [CHARLES and the rest give tokens of fealty]
38971 So now dismiss your army when ye please
38972 Hang up your ensigns let your drums be still
38973 For here we entertain a solemn peace Exeunt
38974 SCENE 5
38975 London The palace
38976 Enter SUFFOLK in conference with the KING
38977 GLOUCESTER and EXETER
38978 KING HENRY Your wondrous rare description noble Earl
38979 Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me
38980 Her virtues graced with external gifts
38981 Do breed love's settled passions in my heart
38982 And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
38983 Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
38984 So am I driven by breath of her renown
38985 Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
38986 Where I may have fruition of her love
38987 SUFFOLK Tush my good lord This superficial tale
38988 Is but a preface of her worthy praise
38989 The chief perfections of that lovely dame
38990 Had I sufficient skill to utter them
38991 Would make a volume of enticing lines
38992 Able to ravish any dull conceit
38993 And which is more she is not so divine
38994 So fullreplete with choice of all delights
38995 But with as humble lowliness of mind
38996 She is content to be at your command
38997 Command I mean of virtuous intents
38998 To love and honour Henry as her lord
38999 KING HENRY And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume
39000 Therefore my Lord Protector give consent
39001 That Margaret may be England's royal Queen
39002 GLOUCESTER So should I give consent to flatter sin
39003 You know my lord your Highness is betroth'd
39004 Unto another lady of esteem
39005 How shall we then dispense with that contract
39006 And not deface your honour with reproach
39007 SUFFOLK As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
39008 Or one that at a triumph having vow'd
39009 To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
39010 By reason of his adversary's odds
39011 A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds
39012 And therefore may be broke without offence
39013 GLOUCESTER Why what I pray is Margaret more than
39014 that
39015 Her father is no better than an earl
39016 Although in glorious titles he excel
39017 SUFFOLK Yes my lord her father is a king
39018 The King of Naples and Jerusalem
39019 And of such great authority in France
39020 As his alliance will confirm our peace
39021 And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance
39022 GLOUCESTER And so the Earl of Armagnac may do
39023 Because he is near kinsman unto Charles
39024 EXETER Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
39025 Where Reignier sooner will receive than give
39026 SUFFOLK A dow'r my lords Disgrace not so your king
39027 That he should be so abject base and poor
39028 To choose for wealth and not for perfect love
39029 Henry is able to enrich his queen
39030 And not to seek a queen to make him rich
39031 So worthless peasants bargain for their wives
39032 As marketmen for oxen sheep or horse
39033 Marriage is a matter of more worth
39034 Than to be dealt in by attorneyship
39035 Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects
39036 Must be companion of his nuptial bed
39037 And therefore lords since he affects her most
39038 It most of all these reasons bindeth us
39039 In our opinions she should be preferr'd
39040 For what is wedlock forced but a hell
39041 An age of discord and continual strife
39042 Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
39043 And is a pattern of celestial peace
39044 Whom should we match with Henry being a king
39045 But Margaret that is daughter to a king
39046 Her peerless feature joined with her birth
39047 Approves her fit for none but for a king
39048 Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
39049 More than in women commonly is seen
39050 Will answer our hope in issue of a king
39051 For Henry son unto a conqueror
39052 Is likely to beget more conquerors
39053 If with a lady of so high resolve
39054 As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love
39055 Then yield my lords and here conclude with me
39056 That Margaret shall be Queen and none but she
39057 KING HENRY Whether it be through force of your report
39058 My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that
39059 My tender youth was never yet attaint
39060 With any passion of inflaming love
39061 I cannot tell but this I am assur'd
39062 I feel such sharp dissension in my breast
39063 Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
39064 As I am sick with working of my thoughts
39065 Take therefore shipping post my lord to France
39066 Agree to any covenants and procure
39067 That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
39068 To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
39069 King Henry's faithful and anointed queen
39070 For your expenses and sufficient charge
39071 Among the people gather up a tenth
39072 Be gone I say for till you do return
39073 I rest perplexed with a thousand cares
39074 And you good uncle banish all offence
39075 If you do censure me by what you were
39076 Not what you are I know it will excuse
39077 This sudden execution of my will
39078 And so conduct me where from company
39079 I may revolve and ruminate my grief Exit
39080 GLOUCESTER Ay grief I fear me both at first and last
39081 Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
39082 SUFFOLK Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes
39083 As did the youthful Paris once to Greece
39084 With hope to find the like event in love
39085 But prosper better than the Troyan did
39086 Margaret shall now be Queen and rule the King
39087 But I will rule both her the King and realm Exit

39155 OF GLOUCESTER SALISBURY WARWICK and CARDINAL BEAUFORT on the one side
39156 the QUEEN SUFFOLK YORK SOMERSET and BUCKINGHAM on the other
39157 SUFFOLK As by your high imperial Majesty
39158 I had in charge at my depart for France
39159 As procurator to your Excellence
39160 To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace
39161 So in the famous ancient city Tours
39162 In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil
39163 The Dukes of Orleans Calaber Bretagne and Alencon
39164 Seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops
39165 I have perform'd my task and was espous'd
39166 And humbly now upon my bended knee
39167 In sight of England and her lordly peers
39168 Deliver up my title in the Queen
39169 To your most gracious hands that are the substance
39170 Of that great shadow I did represent
39171 The happiest gift that ever marquis gave
39172 The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd
39173 KING HENRY Suffolk arise Welcome Queen Margaret
39174 I can express no kinder sign of love
39175 Than this kind kiss O Lord that lends me life
39176 Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
39177 For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
39178 A world of earthly blessings to my soul
39179 If sympathy of love unite our thoughts
39180 QUEEN Great King of England and my gracious lord
39181 The mutual conference that my mind hath had
39182 By day by night waking and in my dreams
39183 In courtly company or at my beads
39184 With you mine alderliefest sovereign
39185 Makes me the bolder to salute my king
39186 With ruder terms such as my wit affords
39187 And overjoy of heart doth minister
39188 KING HENRY Her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
39189 Her words yclad with wisdom's majesty
39190 Makes me from wond'ring fall to weeping joys
39191 Such is the fulness of my heart's content
39192 Lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love
39193 ALL [Kneeling] Long live Queen Margaret England's happiness
39194 QUEEN We thank you all [Flourish]
39195 SUFFOLK My Lord Protector so it please your Grace
39196 Here are the articles of contracted peace
39197 Between our sovereign and the French King Charles
39198 For eighteen months concluded by consent
39199 GLOUCESTER [Reads] 'Imprimis It is agreed between the French King
39200 Charles and William de la Pole Marquess of Suffolk ambassador
39201 for Henry King of England that the said Henry shall espouse the
39202 Lady Margaret daughter unto Reignier King of Naples Sicilia
39203 and Jerusalem and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth
39204 of May next ensuing
39205 Item That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be
39206 released and delivered to the King her father'
39207 [Lets the paper fall]
39208 KING HENRY Uncle how now
39209 GLOUCESTER Pardon me gracious lord
39210 Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
39211 And dimm'd mine eyes that I can read no further
39212 KING HENRY Uncle of Winchester I pray read on
39213 CARDINAL [Reads] 'Item It is further agreed between them that the
39214 duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over
39215 to the King her father and she sent over of the King of
39216 England's own proper cost and charges without having any dowry'
39217 KING HENRY They please us well Lord Marquess kneel down
39218 We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk
39219 And girt thee with the sword Cousin of York
39220 We here discharge your Grace from being Regent
39221 I th parts of France till term of eighteen months
39222 Be full expir'd Thanks uncle Winchester
39223 Gloucester York Buckingham Somerset
39224 Salisbury and Warwick
39225 We thank you all for this great favour done
39226 In entertainment to my princely queen
39227 Come let us in and with all speed provide
39228 To see her coronation be perform'd
39229 Exeunt KING QUEEN and SUFFOLK
39230 GLOUCESTER Brave peers of England pillars of the state
39231 To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief
39232 Your grief the common grief of all the land
39233 What did my brother Henry spend his youth
39234 His valour coin and people in the wars
39235 Did he so often lodge in open field
39236 In winter's cold and summer's parching heat
39237 To conquer France his true inheritance
39238 And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
39239 To keep by policy what Henry got
39240 Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham
39241 Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick
39242 Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy
39243 Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself
39244 With all the learned Council of the realm
39245 Studied so long sat in the Council House
39246 Early and late debating to and fro
39247 How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe
39248 And had his Highness in his infancy
39249 Crowned in Paris in despite of foes
39250 And shall these labours and these honours die
39251 Shall Henry's conquest Bedford's vigilance
39252 Your deeds of war and all our counsel die
39253 O peers of England shameful is this league
39254 Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
39255 Blotting your names from books of memory
39256 Razing the characters of your renown
39257 Defacing monuments of conquer'd France
39258 Undoing all as all had never been
39259 CARDINAL Nephew what means this passionate discourse
39260 This peroration with such circumstance
39261 For France 'tis ours and we will keep it still
39262 GLOUCESTER Ay uncle we will keep it if we can
39263 But now it is impossible we should
39264 Suffolk the newmade duke that rules the roast
39265 Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
39266 Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style
39267 Agrees not with the leanness of his purse
39268 SALISBURY Now by the death of Him that died for all
39269 These counties were the keys of Normandy
39270 But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son
39271 WARWICK For grief that they are past recovery
39272 For were there hope to conquer them again
39273 My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
39274 Anjou and Maine myself did win them both
39275 Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
39276 And are the cities that I got with wounds
39277 Deliver'd up again with peaceful words
39278 Mort Dieu
39279 YORK For Suffolk's duke may he be suffocate
39280 That dims the honour of this warlike isle
39281 France should have torn and rent my very heart
39282 Before I would have yielded to this league
39283 I never read but England's kings have had
39284 Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
39285 And our King Henry gives away his own
39286 To match with her that brings no vantages
39287 GLOUCESTER A proper jest and never heard before
39288 That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
39289 For costs and charges in transporting her
39290 She should have stay'd in France and starv'd in France
39291 Before
39292 CARDINAL My Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot
39293 It was the pleasure of my lord the King
39294 GLOUCESTER My Lord of Winchester I know your mind
39295 'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike
39296 But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye
39297 Rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
39298 I see thy fury if I longer stay
39299 We shall begin our ancient bickerings
39300 Lordings farewell and say when I am gone
39301 I prophesied France will be lost ere long Exit
39302 CARDINAL So there goes our Protector in a rage
39303 'Tis known to you he is mine enemy
39304 Nay more an enemy unto you all
39305 And no great friend I fear me to the King
39306 Consider lords he is the next of blood
39307 And heir apparent to the English crown
39308 Had Henry got an empire by his marriage
39309 And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
39310 There's reason he should be displeas'd at it
39311 Look to it lords let not his smoothing words
39312 Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
39313 What though the common people favour him
39314 Calling him 'Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester'
39315 Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
39316 'Jesu maintain your royal excellence'
39317 With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey'
39318 I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
39319 He will be found a dangerous Protector
39320 BUCKINGHAM Why should he then protect our sovereign
39321 He being of age to govern of himself
39322 Cousin of Somerset join you with me
39323 And all together with the Duke of Suffolk
39324 We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat
39325 CARDINAL This weighty business will not brook delay
39326 I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently Exit
39327 SOMERSET Cousin of Buckingham though Humphrey's pride
39328 And greatness of his place be grief to us
39329 Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
39330 His insolence is more intolerable
39331 Than all the princes in the land beside
39332 If Gloucester be displac'd he'll be Protector
39333 BUCKINGHAM Or thou or I Somerset will be Protector
39334 Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal
39335 Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
39336 SALISBURY Pride went before ambition follows him
39337 While these do labour for their own preferment
39338 Behoves it us to labour for the realm
39339 I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
39340 Did bear him like a noble gentleman
39341 Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal
39342 More like a soldier than a man o th church
39343 As stout and proud as he were lord of all
39344 Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
39345 Unlike the ruler of a commonweal
39346 Warwick my son the comfort of my age
39347 Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
39348 Hath won the greatest favour of the commons
39349 Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey
39350 And brother York thy acts in Ireland
39351 In bringing them to civil discipline
39352 Thy late exploits done in the heart of France
39353 When thou wert Regent for our sovereign
39354 Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people
39355 Join we together for the public good
39356 In what we can to bridle and suppress
39357 The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal
39358 With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition
39359 And as we may cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
39360 While they do tend the profit of the land
39361 WARWICK So God help Warwick as he loves the land
39362 And common profit of his country
39363 YORK And so says York [Aside] for he hath greatest cause
39364 SALISBURY Then let's make haste away and look unto the main
39365 WARWICK Unto the main O father Maine is lost
39366 That Maine which by main force Warwick did win
39367 And would have kept so long as breath did last
39368 Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine
39369 Which I will win from France or else be slain
39370 Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY
39371 YORK Anjou and Maine are given to the French
39372 Paris is lost the state of Normandy
39373 Stands on a tickle point now they are gone
39374 Suffolk concluded on the articles
39375 The peers agreed and Henry was well pleas'd
39376 To changes two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter
39377 I cannot blame them all what is't to them
39378 'Tis thine they give away and not their own
39379 Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
39380 And purchase friends and give to courtezans
39381 Still revelling like lords till all be gone
39382 While as the silly owner of the goods
39383 Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
39384 And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
39385 While all is shar'd and all is borne away
39386 Ready to starve and dare not touch his own
39387 So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
39388 While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold
39389 Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland
39390 Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
39391 As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt
39392 Unto the prince's heart of Calydon
39393 Anjou and Maine both given unto the French
39394 Cold news for me for I had hope of France
39395 Even as I have of fertile England's soil
39396 A day will come when York shall claim his own
39397 And therefore I will take the Nevils parts
39398 And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey
39399 And when I spy advantage claim the crown
39400 For that's the golden mark I seek to hit
39401 Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right
39402 Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
39403 Nor wear the diadem upon his head
39404 Whose churchlike humours fits not for a crown
39405 Then York be still awhile till time do serve
39406 Watch thou and wake when others be asleep
39407 To pry into the secrets of the state
39408 Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love
39409 With his new bride and England's dearbought queen
39410 And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars
39411 Then will I raise aloft the milkwhite rose
39412 With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd
39413 And in my standard bear the arms of York
39414 To grapple with the house of Lancaster
39415 And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown
39416 Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down Exit

39418 The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S house
39419 Enter DUKE and his wife ELEANOR
39420 DUCHESS Why droops my lord like overripen'd corn
39421 Hanging the head at Ceres plenteous load
39422 Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows
39423 As frowning at the favours of the world
39424 Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth
39425 Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
39426 What see'st thou there King Henry's diadem
39427 Enchas'd with all the honours of the world
39428 If so gaze on and grovel on thy face
39429 Until thy head be circled with the same
39430 Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
39431 What is't too short I'll lengthen it with mine
39432 And having both together heav'd it up
39433 We'll both together lift our heads to heaven
39434 And never more abase our sight so low
39435 As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
39436 GLOUCESTER O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord
39437 Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
39438 And may that thought when I imagine ill
39439 Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry
39440 Be my last breathing in this mortal world
39441 My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad
39442 DUCHESS What dream'd my lord Tell me and I'll requite it
39443 With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream
39444 GLOUCESTER Methought this staff mine officebadge in court
39445 Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot
39446 But as I think it was by th Cardinal
39447 And on the pieces of the broken wand
39448 Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset
39449 And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk
39450 This was my dream what it doth bode God knows
39451 DUCHESS Tut this was nothing but an argument
39452 That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
39453 Shall lose his head for his presumption
39454 But list to me my Humphrey my sweet Duke
39455 Methought I sat in seat of majesty
39456 In the cathedral church of Westminster
39457 And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd
39458 Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me
39459 And on my head did set the diadem
39460 GLOUCESTER Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright
39461 Presumptuous dame illnurtur'd Eleanor
39462 Art thou not second woman in the realm
39463 And the Protector's wife belov'd of him
39464 Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
39465 Above the reach or compass of thy thought
39466 And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
39467 To tumble down thy husband and thyself
39468 From top of honour to disgrace's feet
39469 Away from me and let me hear no more
39470 DUCHESS What what my lord Are you so choleric

39481 Exeunt GLOUCESTER and MESSENGER
39482 Follow I must I cannot go before
39483 While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind
39484 Were I a man a duke and next of blood
39485 I would remove these tedious stumblingblocks
39486 And smooth my way upon their headless necks
39487 And being a woman I will not be slack

39514 Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
39515 Yet have I gold flies from another coast
39516 I dare not say from the rich Cardinal
39517 And from the great and newmade Duke of Suffolk
39518 Yet I do find it so for to be plain
39519 They knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour
39520 Have hired me to undermine the Duchess
39521 And buzz these conjurations in her brain
39522 They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker'
39523 Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal's broker
39524 Hume if you take not heed you shall go near
39525 To call them both a pair of crafty knaves
39526 Well so its stands and thus I fear at last
39527 Hume's knavery will be the Duchess wreck
39528 And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall

39576 What shall King Henry be a pupil still
39577 Under the surly Gloucester's governance
39578 Am I a queen in title and in style
39579 And must be made a subject to a duke
39580 I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours
39581 Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
39582 And stol'st away the ladies hearts of France
39583 I thought King Henry had resembled thee
39584 In courage courtship and proportion
39585 But all his mind is bent to holiness
39586 To number AveMaries on his beads
39587 His champions are the prophets and apostles
39588 His weapons holy saws of sacred writ
39589 His study is his tiltyard and his loves
39590 Are brazen images of canonized saints
39591 I would the college of the Cardinals
39592 Would choose him Pope and carry him to Rome

39603 Cannot do more in England than the Nevils
39604 Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers
39605 QUEEN Not all these lords do vex me half so much
39606 As that proud dame the Lord Protector's wife
39607 She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
39608 More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife
39609 Strangers in court do take her for the Queen
39610 She bears a duke's revenues on her back
39611 And in her heart she scorns our poverty
39612 Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her
39613 Contemptuous baseborn callet as she is
39614 She vaunted 'mongst her minions t other day
39615 The very train of her worst wearing gown

39617 Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
39618 SUFFOLK Madam myself have lim'd a bush for her
39619 And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds

39693 But God in mercy so deal with my soul
39694 As I in duty love my king and country

39747 This is the law and this Duke Humphrey's doom

40072 And for my wife I know not how it stands
40073 Sorry I am to hear what I have heard
40074 Noble she is but if she have forgot
40075 Honour and virtue and convers'd with such
40076 As like to pitch defile nobility
40077 I banish her my bed and company
40078 And give her as a prey to law and shame
40079 That hath dishonoured Gloucester's honest name
40080 KING HENRY Well for this night we will repose us here
40081 Tomorrow toward London back again
40082 To look into this business thoroughly
40083 And call these foul offenders to their answers
40084 And poise the cause in justice equal scales

40086 Flourish Exeunt
40087 SCENE II
40088 London The DUKE OF YORK'S garden
40089 Enter YORK SALISBURY and WARWICK
40090 YORK Now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
40091 Our simple supper ended give me leave
40092 In this close walk to satisfy myself
40093 In craving your opinion of my tide
40094 Which is infallible to England's crown
40095 SALISBURY My lord I long to hear it at full
40096 WARWICK Sweet York begin and if thy claim be good
40097 The Nevils are thy subjects to command
40098 YORK Then thus
40099 Edward the Third my lords had seven sons
40100 The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales
40101 The second William of Hatfield and the third
40102 Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom
40103 Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster
40104 The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York
40105 The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester
40106 William of Windsor was the seventh and last
40107 Edward the Black Prince died before his father
40108 And left behind him Richard his only son
40109 Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king
40110 Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster
40111 The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt
40112 Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth
40113 Seiz'd on the realm depos'd the rightful king
40114 Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came
40115 And him to Pomfret where as all you know
40116 Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously
40117 WARWICK Father the Duke hath told the truth
40118 Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown
40119 YORK Which now they hold by force and not by right
40120 For Richard the first son's heir being dead
40121 The issue of the next son should have reign'd
40122 SALISBURY But William of Hatfield died without an heir
40123 YORK The third son Duke of Clarence from whose line
40124 I claim the crown had issue Philippe a daughter
40125 Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
40126 Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March
40127 Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor
40128 SALISBURY This Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke
40129 As I have read laid claim unto the crown
40130 And but for Owen Glendower had been king
40131 Who kept him in captivity till he died
40132 But to the rest
40133 YORK His eldest sister Anne
40134 My mother being heir unto the crown
40135 Married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was
40136 To Edmund Langley Edward the Third's fifth son son
40137 By her I claim the kingdom she was heir
40138 To Roger Earl of March who was the son
40139 Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe
40140 Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence
40141 So if the issue of the elder son
40142 Succeed before the younger I am King
40143 WARWICK What plain proceedings is more plain than this
40144 Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt
40145 The fourth son York claims it from the third
40146 Till Lionel's issue fails his should not reign
40147 It fails not yet but flourishes in thee
40148 And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
40149 Then father Salisbury kneel we together
40150 And in this private plot be we the first
40151 That shall salute our rightful sovereign
40152 With honour of his birthright to the crown
40153 BOTH Long live our sovereign Richard England's King
40154 YORK We thank you lords But I am not your king
40155 Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
40156 With heartblood of the house of Lancaster
40157 And that's not suddenly to be perform'd
40158 But with advice and silent secrecy
40159 Do you as I do in these dangerous days
40160 Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence
40161 At Beaufort's pride at Somerset's ambition
40162 At Buckingham and all the crew of them
40163 Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock
40164 That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey
40165 'Tis that they seek and they in seeking that
40166 Shall find their deaths if York can prophesy
40167 SALISBURY My lord break we off we know your mind at full
40168 WARWICK My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
40169 Shall one day make the Duke of York a king
40170 YORK And Nevil this I do assure myself
40171 Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
40172 The greatest man in England but the King Exeunt

40296 To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess
40297 Uneath may she endure the flinty streets
40298 To tread them with her tenderfeeling feet
40299 Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
40300 The abject people gazing on thy face
40301 With envious looks laughing at thy shame
40302 That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels

40317 And ban thine enemies both mine and thine
40318 GLOUCESTER Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief
40319 DUCHESS Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself
40320 For whilst I think I am thy married wife

40323 Mail'd up in shame with papers on my back
40324 And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
40325 To see my tears and hear my deepfet groans
40326 The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet

40331 Or count them happy that enjoy the sun
40332 No dark shall be my light and night my day

40334 Sometimes I'll say I am Duke Humphrey's wife
40335 And he a prince and ruler of the land

40337 As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess
40338 Was made a wonder and a pointingstock
40339 To every idle rascal follower
40340 But be thou mild and blush not at my shame
40341 Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
40342 Hang over thee as sure it shortly will
40343 For Suffolk he that can do all in all
40344 With her that hateth thee and hates us all
40345 And York and impious Beaufort that false priest
40346 Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings
40347 And fly thou how thou canst they'll tangle thee
40348 But fear not thou until thy foot be snar'd
40349 Nor never seek prevention of thy foes
40350 GLOUCESTER Ah Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry
40351 I must offend before I be attainted
40352 And had I twenty times so many foes
40353 And each of them had twenty times their power
40354 All these could not procure me any scathe
40355 So long as I am loyal true and crimeless
40356 Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
40357 Why yet thy scandal were not wip'd away
40358 But I in danger for the breach of law
40359 Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell
40360 I pray thee sort thy heart to patience
40361 These few days wonder will be quickly worn

40413 ACT III SCENE I
40414 The Abbey at Bury St Edmunds
40415 Sound a sennet Enter the KING the QUEEN CARDINAL SUFFOLK YORK
40416 BUCKINGHAM SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament
40417 KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come
40418 'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
40419 Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now
40420 QUEEN Can you not see or will ye not observe
40421 The strangeness of his alter'd countenance
40422 With what a majesty he bears himself
40423 How insolent of late he is become
40424 How proud how peremptory and unlike himself
40425 We know the time since he was mild and affable
40426 And if we did but glance a faroff look
40427 Immediately he was upon his knee
40428 That all the court admir'd him for submission
40429 But meet him now and be it in the morn
40430 When every one will give the time of day
40431 He knits his brow and shows an angry eye
40432 And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
40433 Disdaining duty that to us belongs
40434 Small curs are not regarded when they grin
40435 But great men tremble when the lion roars
40436 And Humphrey is no little man in England
40437 First note that he is near you in descent
40438 And should you fall he is the next will mount
40439 Me seemeth then it is no policy
40440 Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
40441 And his advantage following your decease
40442 That he should come about your royal person
40443 Or be admitted to your Highness Council
40444 By flattery hath he won the commons hearts
40445 And when he please to make commotion
40446 'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him
40447 Now 'tis the spring and weeds are shallowrooted
40448 Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden
40449 And choke the herbs for want of husbandry
40450 The reverent care I bear unto my lord
40451 Made me collect these dangers in the Duke
40452 If it be fond can it a woman's fear
40453 Which fear if better reasons can supplant
40454 I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the Duke
40455 My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York
40456 Reprove my allegation if you can
40457 Or else conclude my words effectual
40458 SUFFOLK Well hath your Highness seen into this duke
40459 And had I first been put to speak my mind
40460 I think I should have told your Grace's tale
40461 The Duchess by his subornation
40462 Upon my life began her devilish practices
40463 Or if he were not privy to those faults
40464 Yet by reputing of his high descent
40465 As next the King he was successive heir
40466 And such high vaunts of his nobility
40467 Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess
40468 By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall
40469 Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
40470 And in his simple show he harbours treason
40471 The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
40472 No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man
40473 Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
40474 CARDINAL Did he not contrary to form of law
40475 Devise strange deaths for small offences done
40476 YORK And did he not in his protectorship
40477 Levy great sums of money through the realm
40478 For soldiers pay in France and never sent it
40479 By means whereof the towns each day revolted
40480 BUCKINGHAM Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
40481 Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey
40482 KING HENRY My lords at once the care you have of us
40483 To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
40484 Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience
40485 Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
40486 From meaning treason to our royal person
40487 As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
40488 The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given
40489 To dream on evil or to work my downfall
40490 QUEEN Ah what's more dangerous than this fond affiance
40491 Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrow'd
40492 For he's disposed as the hateful raven
40493 Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him
40494 For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf
40495 Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
40496 Take heed my lord the welfare of us all
40497 Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
40498 Enter SOMERSET
40499 SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign
40500 KING HENRY Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France
40501 SOMERSET That all your interest in those territories
40502 Is utterly bereft you all is lost
40503 KING HENRY Cold news Lord Somerset but God's will be done
40504 YORK [Aside] Cold news for me for I had hope of France
40505 As firmly as I hope for fertile England
40506 Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
40507 And caterpillars eat my leaves away
40508 But I will remedy this gear ere long
40509 Or sell my title for a glorious grave
40510 Enter GLOUCESTER
40511 GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the King
40512 Pardon my liege that I have stay'd so long
40513 SUFFOLK Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon
40514 Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
40515 I do arrest thee of high treason here
40516 GLOUCESTER Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
40517 Nor change my countenance for this arrest
40518 A heart unspotted is not easily daunted
40519 The purest spring is not so free from mud
40520 As I am clear from treason to my sovereign
40521 Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty
40522 YORK 'Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France
40523 And being Protector stay'd the soldiers pay
40524 By means whereof his Highness hath lost France
40525 GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so What are they that think it
40526 I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
40527 Nor ever had one penny bribe from France
40528 So help me God as I have watch'd the night
40529 Ay night by night in studying good for England
40530 That doit that e'er I wrested from the King
40531 Or any groat I hoarded to my use
40532 Be brought against me at my trialday
40533 No many a pound of mine own proper store
40534 Because I would not tax the needy commons
40535 Have I dispursed to the garrisons
40536 And never ask'd for restitution
40537 CARDINAL It serves you well my lord to say so much
40538 GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth so help me God
40539 YORK In your protectorship you did devise
40540 Strange tortures for offenders never heard of
40541 That England was defam'd by tyranny
40542 GLOUCESTER Why 'tis well known that whiles I was Protector
40543 Pity was all the fault that was in me
40544 For I should melt at an offender's tears
40545 And lowly words were ransom for their fault
40546 Unless it were a bloody murderer
40547 Or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers
40548 I never gave them condign punishment
40549 Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortur'd
40550 Above the felon or what trespass else
40551 SUFFOLK My lord these faults are easy quickly answer'd
40552 But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
40553 Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
40554 I do arrest you in His Highness name
40555 And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
40556 To keep until your further time of trial
40557 KING HENRY My Lord of Gloucester 'tis my special hope
40558 That you will clear yourself from all suspense
40559 My conscience tells me you are innocent
40560 GLOUCESTER Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
40561 Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition
40562 And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand
40563 Foul subornation is predominant
40564 And equity exil'd your Highness land
40565 I know their complot is to have my life
40566 And if my death might make this island happy
40567 And prove the period of their tyranny
40568 I would expend it with all willingness
40569 But mine is made the prologue to their play
40570 For thousands more that yet suspect no peril
40571 Will not conclude their plotted tragedy
40572 Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
40573 And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate
40574 Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
40575 The envious load that lies upon his heart
40576 And dogged York that reaches at the moon
40577 Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back
40578 By false accuse doth level at my life
40579 And you my sovereign lady with the rest
40580 Causeless have laid disgraces on my head
40581 And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
40582 My liefest liege to be mine enemy
40583 Ay all of you have laid your heads together
40584 Myself had notice of your conventicles
40585 And all to make away my guiltless life
40586 I shall not want false witness to condemn me
40587 Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
40588 The ancient proverb will be well effected
40589 'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog'
40590 CARDINAL My liege his railing is intolerable
40591 If those that care to keep your royal person
40592 From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage
40593 Be thus upbraided chid and rated at
40594 And the offender granted scope of speech
40595 'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace
40596 SUFFOLK Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
40597 With ignominious words though clerkly couch'd
40598 As if she had suborned some to swear
40599 False allegations to o'erthrow his state
40600 QUEEN But I can give the loser leave to chide
40601 GLOUCESTER Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed
40602 Beshrew the winners for they play'd me false
40603 And well such losers may have leave to speak
40604 BUCKINGHAM He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day
40605 Lord Cardinal he is your prisoner
40606 CARDINAL Sirs take away the Duke and guard him sure
40607 GLOUCESTER Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch
40608 Before his legs be firm to bear his body
40609 Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
40610 And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
40611 Ah that my fear were false ah that it were
40612 For good King Henry thy decay I fear Exit guarded
40613 KING HENRY My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
40614 Do or undo as if ourself were here
40615 QUEEN What will your Highness leave the Parliament
40616 KING HENRY Ay Margaret my heart is drown'd with grief
40617 Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
40618 My body round engirt with misery
40619 For what's more miserable than discontent
40620 Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see
40621 The map of honour truth and loyalty
40622 And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come
40623 That e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith
40624 What louring star now envies thy estate
40625 That these great lords and Margaret our Queen
40626 Do seek subversion of thy harmless life
40627 Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
40628 And as the butcher takes away the calf
40629 And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
40630 Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse
40631 Even so remorseless have they borne him hence
40632 And as the dam runs lowing up and down
40633 Looking the way her harmless young one went
40634 And can do nought but wail her darling's loss
40635 Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
40636 With sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes
40637 Look after him and cannot do him good
40638 So mighty are his vowed enemies
40639 His fortunes I will weep and 'twixt each groan
40640 Say 'Who's a traitor Gloucester he is none Exit
40641 QUEEN Free lords cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams
40642 Henry my lord is cold in great affairs
40643 Too full of foolish pity and Gloucester's show
40644 Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
40645 With sorrow snares relenting passengers
40646 Or as the snake roll'd in a flow'ring bank
40647 With shining checker'd slough doth sting a child
40648 That for the beauty thinks it excellent
40649 Believe me lords were none more wise than I
40650 And yet herein I judge mine own wit good
40651 This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
40652 To rid us from the fear we have of him
40653 CARDINAL That he should die is worthy policy
40654 But yet we want a colour for his death
40655 'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law
40656 SUFFOLK But in my mind that were no policy
40657 The King will labour still to save his life
40658 The commons haply rise to save his life
40659 And yet we have but trivial argument
40660 More than mistrust that shows him worthy death
40661 YORK So that by this you would not have him die
40662 SUFFOLK Ah York no man alive so fain as I
40663 YORK 'Tis York that hath more reason for his death
40664 But my Lord Cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk
40665 Say as you think and speak it from your souls
40666 Were't not all one an empty eagle were set
40667 To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
40668 As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector
40669 QUEEN So the poor chicken should be sure of death
40670 SUFFOLK Madam 'tis true and were't not madness then
40671 To make the fox surveyor of the fold
40672 Who being accus'd a crafty murderer
40673 His guilt should be but idly posted over
40674 Because his purpose is not executed
40675 No let him die in that he is a fox
40676 By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock
40677 Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood
40678 As Humphrey prov'd by reasons to my liege
40679 And do not stand on quillets how to slay him
40680 Be it by gins by snares by subtlety
40681 Sleeping or waking 'tis no matter how
40682 So he be dead for that is good deceit
40683 Which mates him first that first intends deceit
40684 QUEEN Thricenoble Suffolk 'tis resolutely spoke
40685 SUFFOLK Not resolute except so much were done
40686 For things are often spoke and seldom meant
40687 But that my heart accordeth with my tongue
40688 Seeing the deed is meritorious
40689 And to preserve my sovereign from his foe
40690 Say but the word and I will be his priest
40691 CARDINAL But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk
40692 Ere you can take due orders for a priest
40693 Say you consent and censure well the deed
40694 And I'll provide his executioner
40695 I tender so the safety of my liege
40696 SUFFOLK Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
40697 QUEEN And so say I
40698 YORK And I And now we three have spoke it
40699 It skills not greatly who impugns our doom
40700 Enter a POST
40701 POST Great lords from Ireland am I come amain
40702 To signify that rebels there are up
40703 And put the Englishmen unto the sword
40704 Send succours lords and stop the rage betime
40705 Before the wound do grow uncurable
40706 For being green there is great hope of help
40707 CARDINAL A breach that craves a quick expedient stop
40708 What counsel give you in this weighty cause
40709 YORK That Somerset be sent as Regent thither
40710 'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd
40711 Witness the fortune he hath had in France
40712 SOMERSET If York with all his farfet policy
40713 Had been the Regent there instead of me
40714 He never would have stay'd in France so long
40715 YORK No not to lose it all as thou hast done
40716 I rather would have lost my life betimes
40717 Than bring a burden of dishonour home
40718 By staying there so long till all were lost
40719 Show me one scar character'd on thy skin
40720 Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win
40721 QUEEN Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
40722 If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
40723 No more good York sweet Somerset be still
40724 Thy fortune York hadst thou been Regent there
40725 Might happily have prov'd far worse than his
40726 YORK What worse than nought Nay then a shame take all
40727 SOMERSET And in the number thee that wishest shame
40728 CARDINAL My Lord of York try what your fortune is
40729 Th uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
40730 And temper clay with blood of Englishmen
40731 To Ireland will you lead a band of men
40732 Collected choicely from each county some
40733 And try your hap against the Irishmen
40734 YORK I will my lord so please his Majesty
40735 SUFFOLK Why our authority is his consent
40736 And what we do establish he confirms
40737 Then noble York take thou this task in hand
40738 YORK I am content provide me soldiers lords
40739 Whiles I take order for mine own affairs
40740 SUFFOLK A charge Lord York that I will see perform'd
40741 But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey
40742 CARDINAL No more of him for I will deal with him
40743 That henceforth he shall trouble us no more
40744 And so break off the day is almost spent
40745 Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event
40746 YORK My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days
40747 At Bristol I expect my soldiers
40748 For there I'll ship them all for Ireland
40749 SUFFOLK I'll see it truly done my Lord of York
40750 Exeunt all but YORK
40751 YORK Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts
40752 And change misdoubt to resolution
40753 Be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art
40754 Resign to death it is not worth th enjoying
40755 Let palefac'd fear keep with the meanborn man
40756 And find no harbour in a royal heart
40757 Faster than springtime show'rs comes thought on thought
40758 And not a thought but thinks on dignity
40759 My brain more busy than the labouring spider
40760 Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
40761 Well nobles well 'tis politicly done
40762 To send me packing with an host of men
40763 I fear me you but warm the starved snake
40764 Who cherish'd in your breasts will sting your hearts
40765 'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me
40766 I take it kindly Yet be well assur'd
40767 You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands
40768 Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band
40769 I will stir up in England some black storm
40770 Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
40771 And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
40772 Until the golden circuit on my head
40773 Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams
40774 Do calm the fury of this madbred flaw
40775 And for a minister of my intent
40776 I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman
40777 John Cade of Ashford
40778 To make commotion as full well he can
40779 Under the tide of John Mortimer
40780 In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
40781 Oppose himself against a troop of kerns
40782 And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts
40783 Were almost like a sharpquill'd porpentine
40784 And in the end being rescu'd I have seen
40785 Him caper upright like a wild Morisco
40786 Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
40787 Full often like a shaghair'd crafty kern
40788 Hath he conversed with the enemy
40789 And undiscover'd come to me again
40790 And given me notice of their villainies
40791 This devil here shall be my substitute
40792 For that John Mortimer which now is dead
40793 In face in gait in speech he doth resemble
40794 By this I shall perceive the commons mind
40795 How they affect the house and claim of York
40796 Say he be taken rack'd and tortured
40797 I know no pain they can inflict upon him
40798 Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms
40799 Say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will
40800 Why then from Ireland come I with my strength
40801 And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd
40802 For Humphrey being dead as he shall be
40803 And Henry put apart the next for me Exit
40804 SCENE II
40805 Bury St Edmunds A room of state
40806 Enter two or three MURDERERS running over the stage
40807 from the murder of DUKE HUMPHREY
40808 FIRST MURDERER Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know
40809 We have dispatch'd the Duke as he commanded
40810 SECOND MURDERER O that it were to do What have we done

40815 FIRST MURDERER Ay my good lord he's dead
40816 SUFFOLK Why that's well said Go get you to my house
40817 I will reward you for this venturous deed
40818 The King and all the peers are here at hand
40819 Have you laid fair the bed Is all things well
40820 According as I gave directions
40821 FIRST MURDERER 'Tis my good lord
40822 SUFFOLK Away be gone Exeunt MURDERERS
40823 Sound trumpets Enter the KING the QUEEN
40824 CARDINAL SOMERSET with attendants
40825 KING HENRY Go call our uncle to our presence straight
40826 Say we intend to try his Grace today
40827 If he be guilty as 'tis published
40828 SUFFOLK I'll call him presently my noble lord Exit
40829 KING HENRY Lords take your places and I pray you all
40830 Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester
40831 Than from true evidence of good esteem
40832 He be approv'd in practice culpable
40833 QUEEN God forbid any malice should prevail
40834 That faultless may condemn a nobleman
40835 Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion
40836 KING HENRY I thank thee Meg these words content me much
40837 Reenter SUFFOLK
40838 How now Why look'st thou pale Why tremblest thou
40839 Where is our uncle What's the matter Suffolk
40840 SUFFOLK Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead
40841 QUEEN Marry God forfend
40842 CARDINAL God's secret judgment I did dream tonight
40843 The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word
40844 [The KING swoons]
40845 QUEEN How fares my lord Help lords The King is dead
40846 SOMERSET Rear up his body wring him by the nose
40847 QUEEN Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes
40848 SUFFOLK He doth revive again madam be patient
40849 KING O heavenly God
40850 QUEEN How fares my gracious lord
40851 SUFFOLK Comfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfort
40852 KING HENRY What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me
40853 Came he right now to sing a raven's note
40854 Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow'rs
40855 And thinks he that the chirping of a wren
40856 By crying comfort from a hollow breast
40857 Can chase away the first conceived sound
40858 Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words
40859 Lay not thy hands on me forbear I say
40860 Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
40861 Thou baleful messenger out of my sight
40862 Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
40863 Sits in grim majesty to fright the world
40864 Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
40865 Yet do not go away come basilisk
40866 And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
40867 For in the shade of death I shall find joy
40868 In life but double death'now Gloucester's dead
40869 QUEEN Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus
40870 Although the Duke was enemy to him
40871 Yet he most Christianlike laments his death
40872 And for myself foe as he was to me
40873 Might liquid tears or heartoffending groans
40874 Or bloodconsuming sighs recall his life
40875 I would be blind with weeping sick with groans
40876 Look pale as primrose with blooddrinking sighs
40877 And all to have the noble Duke alive
40878 What know I how the world may deem of me
40879 For it is known we were but hollow friends
40880 It may be judg'd I made the Duke away
40881 So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
40882 And princes courts be fill'd with my reproach
40883 This get I by his death Ay me unhappy
40884 To be a queen and crown'd with infamy
40885 KING HENRY Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man
40886 QUEEN Be woe for me more wretched than he is
40887 What dost thou turn away and hide thy face
40888 I am no loathsome leper look on me
40889 What art thou like the adder waxen deaf
40890 Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn Queen
40891 Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb
40892 Why then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy
40893 Erect his statue and worship it
40894 And make my image but an alehouse sign
40895 Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
40896 And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
40897 Drove back again unto my native clime
40898 What boded this but wellforewarning wind
40899 Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest
40900 Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'
40901 What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts
40902 And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves
40903 And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore
40904 Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
40905 Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer
40906 But left that hateful office unto thee
40907 The prettyvaulting sea refus'd to drown me
40908 Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore
40909 With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
40910 The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands
40911 And would not dash me with their ragged sides
40912 Because thy flinty heart more hard than they
40913 Might in thy palace perish Margaret
40914 As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs
40915 When from thy shore the tempest beat us back
40916 I stood upon the hatches in the storm
40917 And when the dusky sky began to rob
40918 My earnestgaping sight of thy land's view
40919 I took a costly jewel from my neck
40920 A heart it was bound in with diamonds
40921 And threw it towards thy land The sea receiv'd it
40922 And so I wish'd thy body might my heart
40923 And even with this I lost fair England's view
40924 And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
40925 And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
40926 For losing ken of Albion's wished coast
40927 How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue
40928 The agent of thy foul inconstancy
40929 To sit and witch me as Ascanius did
40930 When he to madding Dido would unfold
40931 His father's acts commenc'd in burning Troy
40932 Am I not witch'd like her Or thou not false like him
40933 Ay me I can no more Die Margaret
40934 For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long
40935 Noise within Enter WARWICK SALISBURY
40936 and many commons
40937 WARWICK It is reported mighty sovereign
40938 That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red
40939 By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means
40940 The commons like an angry hive of bees
40941 That want their leader scatter up and down
40942 And care not who they sting in his revenge
40943 Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
40944 Until they hear the order of his death
40945 KING HENRY That he is dead good Warwick 'tis too true
40946 But how he died God knows not Henry
40947 Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
40948 And comment then upon his sudden death
40949 WARWICK That shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury
40950 With the rude multitude till I return Exit
40951 Exit SALISBURY with the commons
40952 KING HENRY O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts
40953 My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
40954 Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life
40955 If my suspect be false forgive me God
40956 For judgment only doth belong to Thee
40957 Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
40958 With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
40959 Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
40960 To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
40961 And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling
40962 But all in vain are these mean obsequies
40963 And to survey his dead and earthy image
40964 What were it but to make my sorrow greater
40965 Bed put forth with the body Enter WARWICK
40966 WARWICK Come hither gracious sovereign view this body
40967 KING HENRY That is to see how deep my grave is made
40968 For with his soul fled all my worldly solace
40969 For seeing him I see my life in death
40970 WARWICK As surely as my soul intends to live
40971 With that dread King that took our state upon Him
40972 To free us from his Father's wrathful curse
40973 I do believe that violent hands were laid
40974 Upon the life of this thricefamed Duke
40975 SUFFOLK A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
40976 What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow
40977 WARWICK See how the blood is settled in his face
40978 Oft have I seen a timelyparted ghost
40979 Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
40980 Being all descended to the labouring heart
40981 Who in the conflict that it holds with death
40982 Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy
40983 Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
40984 To blush and beautify the cheek again
40985 But see his face is black and full of blood
40986 His eyeballs further out than when he liv'd
40987 Staring full ghastly like a strangled man
40988 His hair uprear'd his nostrils stretch'd with struggling
40989 His hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd
40990 And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdu'd
40991 Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
40992 His wellproportion'd beard made rough and rugged
40993 Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged
40994 It cannot be but he was murd'red here
40995 The least of all these signs were probable
40996 SUFFOLK Why Warwick who should do the Duke to death
40997 Myself and Beaufort had him in protection
40998 And we I hope sir are no murderers
40999 WARWICK But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes
41000 And you forsooth had the good Duke to keep
41001 'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend
41002 And 'tis well seen he found an enemy
41003 QUEEN Then you belike suspect these noblemen
41004 As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death
41005 WARWICK Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
41006 And sees fast by a butcher with an axe
41007 But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter
41008 Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
41009 But may imagine how the bird was dead
41010 Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
41011 Even so suspicious is this tragedy
41012 QUEEN Are you the butcher Suffolk Where's your knife
41013 Is Beaufort term'd a kite Where are his talons
41014 SUFFOLK I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
41015 But here's a vengeful sword rusted with ease
41016 That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
41017 That slanders me with murder's crimson badge
41018 Say if thou dar'st proud Lord of Warwickshire
41019 That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death
41020 Exeunt CARDINAL SOMERSET and others
41021 WARWICK What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him
41022 QUEEN He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
41023 Nor cease to be an arrogant controller
41024 Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
41025 WARWICK Madam be still with reverence may I say
41026 For every word you speak in his behalf
41027 Is slander to your royal dignity
41028 SUFFOLK Bluntwitted lord ignoble in demeanour
41029 If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
41030 Thy mother took into her blameful bed
41031 Some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock
41032 Was graft with crabtree slip whose fruit thou art
41033 And never of the Nevils noble race
41034 WARWICK But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
41035 And I should rob the deathsman of his fee
41036 Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
41037 And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild
41038 I would false murd'rous coward on thy knee
41039 Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
41040 And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
41041 That thou thyself was born in bastardy
41042 And after all this fearful homage done
41043 Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
41044 Pernicious bloodsucker of sleeping men
41045 SUFFOLK Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood
41046 If from this presence thou dar'st go with me
41047 WARWICK Away even now or I will drag thee hence
41048 Unworthy though thou art I'll cope with thee
41049 And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost
41050 Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
41051 KING HENRY What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
41052 Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just
41053 And he but naked though lock'd up in steel
41054 Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
41055 [A noise within]
41056 QUEEN What noise is this
41057 Reenter SUFFOLK and WARWICK with their weapons drawn
41058 KING Why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
41059 Here in our presence Dare you be so bold
41060 Why what tumultuous clamour have we here
41061 SUFFOLK The trait'rous Warwick with the men of Bury
41062 Set all upon me mighty sovereign
41063 Reenter SALISBURY
41064 SALISBURY [To the Commons within] Sirs stand apart the King
41065 shall know your mind
41066 Dread lord the commons send you word by me
41067 Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death
41068 Or banished fair England's territories
41069 They will by violence tear him from your palace
41070 And torture him with grievous ling'ring death
41071 They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died
41072 They say in him they fear your Highness death
41073 And mere instinct of love and loyalty
41074 Free from a stubborn opposite intent
41075 As being thought to contradict your liking
41076 Makes them thus forward in his banishment
41077 They say in care of your most royal person
41078 That if your Highness should intend to sleep
41079 And charge that no man should disturb your rest
41080 In pain of your dislike or pain of death
41081 Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
41082 Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
41083 That slily glided towards your Majesty
41084 It were but necessary you were wak'd
41085 Lest being suffer'd in that harmful slumber
41086 The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
41087 And therefore do they cry though you forbid
41088 That they will guard you whe'er you will or no
41089 From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is
41090 With whose envenomed and fatal sting
41091 Your loving uncle twenty times his worth
41092 They say is shamefully bereft of life
41093 COMMONS [Within] An answer from the King my Lord of Salisbury
41094 SUFFOLK 'Tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds
41095 Could send such message to their sovereign
41096 But you my lord were glad to be employ'd
41097 To show how quaint an orator you are
41098 But all the honour Salisbury hath won
41099 Is that he was the lord ambassador
41100 Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King
41101 COMMONS [Within] An answer from the King or we will all break in
41102 KING HENRY Go Salisbury and tell them all from me
41103 I thank them for their tender loving care
41104 And had I not been cited so by them
41105 Yet did I purpose as they do entreat
41106 For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
41107 Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means
41108 And therefore by His Majesty I swear
41109 Whose far unworthy deputy I am
41110 He shall not breathe infection in this air
41111 But three days longer on the pain of death
41112 Exit SALISBURY
41113 QUEEN O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk
41114 KING HENRY Ungentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk
41115 No more I say if thou dost plead for him
41116 Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
41117 Had I but said I would have kept my word
41118 But when I swear it is irrevocable
41119 If after three days space thou here be'st found
41120 On any ground that I am ruler of
41121 The world shall not be ransom for thy life
41122 Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me
41123 I have great matters to impart to thee
41124 Exeunt all but QUEEN and SUFFOLK
41125 QUEEN Mischance and sorrow go along with you
41126 Heart's discontent and sour affliction
41127 Be playfellows to keep you company
41128 There's two of you the devil make a third
41129 And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
41130 SUFFOLK Cease gentle Queen these execrations
41131 And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave
41132 QUEEN Fie coward woman and softhearted wretch
41133 Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
41134 SUFFOLK A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them
41135 Would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan
41136 I would invent as bitter searching terms
41137 As curst as harsh and horrible to hear
41138 Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth
41139 With full as many signs of deadly hate
41140 As leanfac'd Envy in her loathsome cave
41141 My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
41142 Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
41143 Mine hair be fix'd an end as one distract
41144 Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
41145 And even now my burden'd heart would break
41146 Should I not curse them Poison be their drink
41147 Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
41148 Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
41149 Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks
41150 Their softest touch as smart as lizards stings
41151 Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
41152 And boding screechowls make the consort full
41153 all the foul terrors in darkseated hell
41154 QUEEN Enough sweet Suffolk thou torment'st thyself
41155 And these dread curses like the sun 'gainst glass
41156 Or like an overcharged gun recoil
41157 And turns the force of them upon thyself
41158 SUFFOLK You bade me ban and will you bid me leave
41159 Now by the ground that I am banish'd from
41160 Well could I curse away a winter's night
41161 Though standing naked on a mountain top
41162 Where biting cold would never let grass grow
41163 And think it but a minute spent in sport
41164 QUEEN O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand
41165 That I may dew it with my mournful tears
41166 Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
41167 To wash away my woeful monuments
41168 O could this kiss be printed in thy hand
41169 That thou might'st think upon these by the seal
41170 Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee
41171 So get thee gone that I may know my grief
41172 'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by
41173 As one that surfeits thinking on a want
41174 I will repeal thee or be well assur'd
41175 Adventure to be banished myself
41176 And banished I am if but from thee
41177 Go speak not to me even now be gone
41178 O go not yet Even thus two friends condemn'd
41179 Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
41180 Loather a hundred times to part than die
41181 Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
41182 SUFFOLK Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished
41183 Once by the King and three times thrice by thee
41184 'Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence
41185 A wilderness is populous enough
41186 So Suffolk had thy heavenly company
41187 For where thou art there is the world itself
41188 With every several pleasure in the world
41189 And where thou art not desolation
41190 I can no more Live thou to joy thy life
41191 Myself no joy in nought but that thou liv'st
41192 Enter VAUX
41193 QUEEN Whither goes Vaux so fast What news I prithee
41194 VAUX To signify unto his Majesty
41195 That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death
41196 For suddenly a grievous sickness took him
41197 That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
41198 Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth
41199 Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
41200 Were by his side sometime he calls the King
41201 And whispers to his pillow as to him
41202 The secrets of his overcharged soul
41203 And I am sent to tell his Majesty
41204 That even now he cries aloud for him
41205 QUEEN Go tell this heavy message to the King Exit VAUX
41206 Ay me What is this world What news are these
41207 But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss
41208 Omitting Suffolk's exile my soul's treasure
41209 Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee
41210 And with the southern clouds contend in tears
41211 Theirs for the earth's increase mine for my sorrows
41212 Now get thee hence the King thou know'st is coming
41213 If thou be found by me thou art but dead
41214 SUFFOLK If I depart from thee I cannot live
41215 And in thy sight to die what were it else
41216 But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
41217 Here could I breathe my soul into the air
41218 As mild and gentle as the cradlebabe
41219 Dying with mother's dug between its lips
41220 Where from thy sight I should be raging mad
41221 And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
41222 To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
41223 So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
41224 Or I should breathe it so into thy body
41225 And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium
41226 To die by thee were but to die in jest
41227 From thee to die were torture more than death
41228 O let me stay befall what may befall
41229 QUEEN Away Though parting be a fretful corrosive
41230 It is applied to a deathful wound
41231 To France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee
41232 For whereso'er thou art in this world's globe
41233 I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out
41234 SUFFOLK I go
41235 QUEEN And take my heart with thee [She kisses him]
41236 SUFFOLK A jewel lock'd into the woefull'st cask
41237 That ever did contain a thing of worth
41238 Even as a splitted bark so sunder we
41239 This way fall I to death
41240 QUEEN This way for me Exeunt severally
41241 SCENE III
41242 London CARDINAL BEAUFORT'S bedchamber
41243 Enter the KING SALISBURY and WARWICK to the CARDINAL in bed
41244 KING HENRY How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign
41245 CARDINAL If thou be'st Death I'll give thee England's treasure
41246 Enough to purchase such another island
41247 So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain
41248 KING HENRY Ah what a sign it is of evil life
41249 Where death's approach is seen so terrible
41250 WARWICK Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee
41251 CARDINAL Bring me unto my trial when you will
41252 Died he not in his bed Where should he die
41253 Can I make men live whe'er they will or no
41254 O torture me no more I will confess
41255 Alive again Then show me where he is
41256 I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him
41257 He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
41258 Comb down his hair look look it stands upright
41259 Like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul
41260 Give me some drink and bid the apothecary
41261 Bring the strong poison that I bought of him
41262 KING HENRY O Thou eternal Mover of the heavens
41263 Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
41264 O beat away the busy meddling fiend
41265 That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul
41266 And from his bosom purge this black despair
41267 WARWICK See how the pangs of death do make him grin
41268 SALISBURY Disturb him not let him pass peaceably
41269 KING HENRY Peace to his soul if God's good pleasure be
41270 Lord Card'nal if thou think'st on heaven's bliss
41271 Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
41272 He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him
41273 WARWICK So bad a death argues a monstrous life
41274 KING HENRY Forbear to judge for we are sinners all
41275 Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close
41276 And let us all to meditation Exeunt

41289 SUFFOLK and other GENTLEMEN as prisoners
41290 LIEUTENANT The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
41291 Is crept into the bosom of the sea
41292 And now loudhowling wolves arouse the jades
41293 That drag the tragic melancholy night
41294 Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
41295 Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
41296 Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
41297 Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
41298 For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
41299 Here shall they make their ransom on the sand
41300 Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore
41301 Master this prisoner freely give I thee
41302 And thou that art his mate make boot of this
41303 The other Walter Whitmore is thy share

41313 SECOND GENTLEMAN And so will I and write home for it straight
41314 WHITMORE I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard

41316 And so should these if I might have my will
41317 LIEUTENANT Be not so rash take ransom let him live

41319 Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
41320 WHITMORE And so am I my name is Walter Whitmore
41321 How now Why start'st thou What doth death affright
41322 SUFFOLK Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
41323 A cunning man did calculate my birth
41324 And told me that by water I should die
41325 Yet let not this make thee be bloodyminded
41326 Thy name is Gualtier being rightly sounded
41327 WHITMORE Gualtier or Walter which it is I care not
41328 Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
41329 But with our sword we wip'd away the blot
41330 Therefore when merchantlike I sell revenge
41331 Broke be my sword my arms torn and defac'd
41332 And I proclaim'd a coward through the world
41333 SUFFOLK Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
41334 The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole
41335 WHITMORE The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags
41336 SUFFOLK Ay but these rags are no part of the Duke
41337 Jove sometime went disguis'd and why not I
41338 LIEUTENANT But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be
41339 SUFFOLK Obscure and lowly swain King Henry's blood
41340 The honourable blood of Lancaster
41341 Must not be shed by such a jaded groom
41342 Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup
41343 Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule
41344 And thought thee happy when I shook my head
41345 How often hast thou waited at my cup
41346 Fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board
41347 When I have feasted with Queen Margaret
41348 Remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n
41349 Ay and allay thus thy abortive pride
41350 How in our voidinglobby hast thou stood
41351 And duly waited for my coming forth
41352 This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
41353 And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
41354 WHITMORE Speak Captain shall I stab the forlorn swain
41355 LIEUTENANT First let my words stab him as he hath me
41356 SUFFOLK Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
41357 LIEUTENANT Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
41358 Strike off his head
41359 SUFFOLK Thou dar'st not for thy own
41360 LIEUTENANT Poole
41361 SUFFOLK Poole
41362 LIEUTENANT Ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
41363 Troubles the silver spring where England drinks
41364 Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
41365 For swallowing the treasure of the realm
41366 Thy lips that kiss'd the Queen shall sweep the ground
41367 And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
41368 Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
41369 Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
41370 And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
41371 For daring to affy a mighty lord
41372 Unto the daughter of a worthless king
41373 Having neither subject wealth nor diadem
41374 By devilish policy art thou grown great
41375 And like ambitious Sylla overgorg'd
41376 With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart
41377 By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France
41378 The false revolting Normans thorough thee
41379 Disdain to call us lord and Picardy
41380 Hath slain their governors surpris'd our forts
41381 And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
41382 The princely Warwick and the Nevils all
41383 Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
41384 As hating thee are rising up in arms
41385 And now the house of York thrust from the crown
41386 By shameful murder of a guiltless king
41387 And lofty proud encroaching tyranny
41388 Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
41389 Advance our halffac'd sun striving to shine
41390 Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus'
41391 The commons here in Kent are up in arms
41392 And to conclude reproach and beggary
41393 Is crept into the palace of our King
41394 And all by thee Away convey him hence
41395 SUFFOLK O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder
41396 Upon these paltry servile abject drudges
41397 Small things make base men proud this villain here
41398 Being captain of a pinnace threatens more
41399 Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate
41400 Drones suck not eagles blood but rob beehives
41401 It is impossible that I should die
41402 By such a lowly vassal as thyself
41403 Thy words move rage and not remorse in me
41404 I go of message from the Queen to France
41405 I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel
41406 LIEUTENANT Walter
41407 WHITMORE Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death
41408 SUFFOLK Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear
41409 WHITMORE Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee
41410 What are ye daunted now Now will ye stoop
41411 FIRST GENTLEMAN My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
41412 SUFFOLK Suffolk's imperial tongue is stem and rough
41413 Us'd to command untaught to plead for favour
41414 Far be it we should honour such as these
41415 With humble suit no rather let my head
41416 Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
41417 Save to the God of heaven and to my king
41418 And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
41419 Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom
41420 True nobility is exempt from fear
41421 More can I bear than you dare execute
41422 LIEUTENANT Hale him away and let him talk no more
41423 SUFFOLK Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
41424 That this my death may never be forgot
41425 Great men oft die by vile bezonians
41426 A Roman sworder and banditto slave
41427 Murder'd sweet Tully Brutus bastard hand
41428 Stabb'd Julius Caesar savage islanders
41429 Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates
41430 Exit WALTER with SUFFOLK
41431 LIEUTENANT And as for these whose ransom we have set
41432 It is our pleasure one of them depart

41436 WHITMORE There let his head and lifeless body lie
41437 Until the Queen his mistress bury it Exit
41438 FIRST GENTLEMAN O barbarous and bloody spectacle
41439 His body will I bear unto the King
41440 If he revenge it not yet will his friends
41441 So will the Queen that living held him dear
41442 Exit with the body

41967 Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
41968 Is marching hitherward in proud array
41969 And still proclaimeth as he comes along
41970 His arms are only to remove from thee
41971 The Duke of Somerset whom he terms a traitor
41972 KING HENRY Thus stands my state 'twixt Cade and York distress'd
41973 Like to a ship that having scap'd a tempest
41974 Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate
41975 But now is Cade driven back his men dispers'd
41976 And now is York in arms to second him
41977 I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him
41978 And ask him what's the reason of these arms
41979 Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower
41980 And Somerset we will commit thee thither

41996 ready to famish These five days have I hid me in these woods and
41997 durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now
41998 am I so hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a
41999 thousand years I could stay no longer Wherefore on a brick
42000 wall have I climb'd into this garden to see if I can eat grass
42001 or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a
42002 man's stomach this hot weather And I think this word 'sallet'
42003 was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my
42004 brainpain had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time
42005 when I have been dry and bravely marching it hath serv'd me
42006 instead of a quartpot to drink in and now the word 'sallet'
42007 must serve me to feed on
42008 Enter IDEN
42009 IDEN Lord who would live turmoiled in the court
42010 And may enjoy such quiet walks as these
42011 This small inheritance my father left me
42012 Contenteth me and worth a monarchy
42013 I seek not to wax great by others waning
42014 Or gather wealth I care not with what envy
42015 Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
42016 And sends the poor well pleased from my gate
42017 CADE Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for
42018 entering his feesimple without leave Ah villain thou wilt
42019 betray me and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my
42020 head to him but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and
42021 swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part
42022 IDEN Why rude companion whatsoe'er thou be
42023 I know thee not why then should I betray thee
42024 Is't not enough to break into my garden
42025 And like a thief to come to rob my grounds
42026 Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner
42027 But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
42028 CADE Brave thee Ay by the best blood that ever was broach'd and
42029 beard thee too Look on me well I have eat no meat these five
42030 days yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you
42031 all as dead as a doornail I pray God I may never eat grass
42032 more
42033 IDEN Nay it shall ne'er be said while England stands
42034 That Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent
42035 Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man
42036 Oppose thy steadfastgazing eyes to mine
42037 See if thou canst outface me with thy looks
42038 Set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
42039 Thy hand is but a finger to my fist
42040 Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
42041 My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
42042 And if mine arm be heaved in the air
42043 Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth
42044 As for words whose greatness answers words
42045 Let this my sword report what speech forbears
42046 CADE By my valour the most complete champion that ever I heard
42047 Steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly bon'd
42048 clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath I beseech
42049 God on my knees thou mayst be turn'd to hobnails [Here they
42050 fight CADE falls] O I am slain famine and no other hath slain
42051 me Let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the
42052 ten meals I have lost and I'd defy them all Wither garden and
42053 be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house
42054 because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled
42055 IDEN Is't Cade that I have slain that monstrous traitor
42056 Sword I will hallow thee for this thy deed
42057 And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead
42058 Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point
42059 But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat
42060 To emblaze the honour that thy master got
42061 CADE Iden farewell and be proud of thy victory Tell Kent from
42062 me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be
42063 cowards for I that never feared any am vanquished by famine
42064 not by valour [Dies]
42065 IDEN How much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge
42066 Die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
42067 And as I thrust thy body in with my sword
42068 So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell
42069 Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
42070 Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
42071 And there cut off thy most ungracious head
42072 Which I will bear in triumph to the King
42073 Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon Exit

42082 ACT V SCENE I
42083 Fields between Dartford and Blackheath
42084 Enter YORK and his army of Irish with drum and colours
42085 YORK From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
42086 And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head
42087 Ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright
42088 To entertain great England's lawful king
42089 Ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
42090 Let them obey that knows not how to rule
42091 This hand was made to handle nought but gold
42092 I cannot give due action to my words
42093 Except a sword or sceptre balance it
42094 A sceptre shall it have have I a soul
42095 On which I'll toss the flowerdeluce of France
42096 Enter BUCKINGHAM
42097 [Aside] Whom have we here Buckingham to disturb me
42098 The King hath sent him sure I must dissemble
42099 BUCKINGHAM York if thou meanest well I greet thee well
42100 YORK Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting
42101 Art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
42102 BUCKINGHAM A messenger from Henry our dread liege
42103 To know the reason of these arms in peace
42104 Or why thou being a subject as I am
42105 Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
42106 Should raise so great a power without his leave
42107 Or dare to bring thy force so near the court
42108 YORK [Aside] Scarce can I speak my choler is so great
42109 O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint
42110 I am so angry at these abject terms
42111 And now like Ajax Telamonius
42112 On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury
42113 I am far better born than is the King
42114 More like a king more kingly in my thoughts
42115 But I must make fair weather yet awhile
42116 Till Henry be more weak and I more strong
42117 Buckingham I prithee pardon me
42118 That I have given no answer all this while
42119 My mind was troubled with deep melancholy
42120 The cause why I have brought this army hither
42121 Is to remove proud Somerset from the King
42122 Seditious to his Grace and to the state
42123 BUCKINGHAM That is too much presumption on thy part
42124 But if thy arms be to no other end
42125 The King hath yielded unto thy demand
42126 The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower
42127 YORK Upon thine honour is he prisoner
42128 BUCKINGHAM Upon mine honour he is prisoner
42129 YORK Then Buckingham I do dismiss my pow'rs
42130 Soldiers I thank you all disperse yourselves
42131 Meet me tomorrow in Saint George's field
42132 You shall have pay and everything you wish
42133 And let my sovereign virtuous Henry
42134 Command my eldest son nay all my sons
42135 As pledges of my fealty and love
42136 I'll send them all as willing as I live
42137 Lands goods horse armour anything I have
42138 Is his to use so Somerset may die
42139 BUCKINGHAM York I commend this kind submission
42140 We twain will go into his Highness tent
42141 Enter the KING and attendants
42142 KING HENRY Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us
42143 That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm
42144 YORK In all submission and humility
42145 York doth present himself unto your Highness
42146 KING HENRY Then what intends these forces thou dost bring
42147 YORK To heave the traitor Somerset from hence
42148 And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade
42149 Who since I heard to be discomfited
42150 Enter IDEN with CADE's head
42151 IDEN If one so rude and of so mean condition
42152 May pass into the presence of a king
42153 Lo I present your Grace a traitor's head
42154 The head of Cade whom I in combat slew
42155 KING HENRY The head of Cade Great God how just art Thou
42156 O let me view his visage being dead
42157 That living wrought me such exceeding trouble
42158 Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him
42159 IDEN I was an't like your Majesty
42160 KING HENRY How art thou call'd And what is thy degree
42161 IDEN Alexander Iden that's my name
42162 A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king
42163 BUCKINGHAM So please it you my lord 'twere not amiss
42164 He were created knight for his good service
42165 KING HENRY Iden kneel down [He kneels] Rise up a knight
42166 We give thee for reward a thousand marks
42167 And will that thou thenceforth attend on us
42168 IDEN May Iden live to merit such a bounty
42169 And never live but true unto his liege
42170 Enter the QUEEN and SOMERSET
42171 KING HENRY See Buckingham Somerset comes with th Queen
42172 Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke
42173 QUEEN For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head
42174 But boldly stand and front him to his face
42175 YORK How now Is Somerset at liberty
42176 Then York unloose thy longimprisoned thoughts
42177 And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
42178 Shall I endure the sight of Somerset
42179 False king why hast thou broken faith with me
42180 Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse
42181 King did I call thee No thou art not king
42182 Not fit to govern and rule multitudes
42183 Which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor
42184 That head of thine doth not become a crown
42185 Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
42186 And not to grace an awful princely sceptre
42187 That gold must round engirt these brows of mine
42188 Whose smile and frown like to Achilles spear
42189 Is able with the change to kill and cure
42190 Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
42191 And with the same to act controlling laws
42192 Give place By heaven thou shalt rule no more
42193 O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler
42194 SOMERSET O monstrous traitor I arrest thee York
42195 Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown

42244 RICHARD Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur
42245 Run back and bite because he was withheld
42246 Who being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw
42247 Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried

42258 And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
42259 O where is faith O where is loyalty
42260 If it be banish'd from the frosty head
42261 Where shall it find a harbour in the earth
42262 Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
42263 And shame thine honourable age with blood
42264 Why art thou old and want'st experience
42265 Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it

42272 KING HENRY Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
42273 SALISBURY I have
42274 KING HENRY Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
42275 SALISBURY It is great sin to swear unto a sin
42276 But greater sin to keep a sinful oath
42277 Who can be bound by any solemn vow
42278 To do a murd'rous deed to rob a man
42279 To force a spotless virgin's chastity
42280 To reave the orphan of his patrimony
42281 To wring the widow from her custom'd right
42282 And have no other reason for this wrong
42283 But that he was bound by a solemn oath
42284 QUEEN A subtle traitor needs no sophister
42285 KING HENRY Call Buckingham and bid him arm himself
42286 YORK Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast

42290 To keep thee from the tempest of the field
42291 CLIFFORD I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm
42292 Than any thou canst conjure up today
42293 And that I'll write upon thy burgonet
42294 Might I but know thee by thy household badge
42295 WARWICK Now by my father's badge old Nevil's crest
42296 The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff
42297 This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet
42298 As on a mountaintop the cedar shows
42299 That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
42300 Even to affright thee with the view thereof
42301 CLIFFORD And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
42302 And tread it under foot with all contempt
42303 Despite the berard that protects the bear
42304 YOUNG CLIFFORD And so to arms victorious father
42305 To quell the rebels and their complices
42306 RICHARD Fie charity for shame Speak not in spite
42307 For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight

42326 Even of the bonny beast he lov'd so well
42327 Enter OLD CLIFFORD
42328 WARWICK Of one or both of us the time is come
42329 YORK Hold Warwick seek thee out some other chase
42330 For I myself must hunt this deer to death

42334 CLIFFORD What seest thou in me York Why dost thou pause
42335 YORK With thy brave bearing should I be in love
42336 But that thou art so fast mine enemy
42337 CLIFFORD Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
42338 But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason
42339 YORK So let it help me now against thy sword
42340 As I in justice and true right express it
42341 CLIFFORD My soul and body on the action both
42342 YORK A dreadful lay Address thee instantly

42348 YOUNG CLIFFORD Shame and confusion All is on the rout
42349 Fear frames disorder and disorder wounds

42351 Whom angry heavens do make their minister
42352 Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
42353 Hot coals of vengeance Let no soldier fly
42354 He that is truly dedicate to war
42355 Hath no selflove nor he that loves himself
42356 Hath not essentially but by circumstance
42357 The name of valour [Sees his father's body]
42358 O let the vile world end
42359 And the premised flames of the last day
42360 Knit earth and heaven together
42361 Now let the general trumpet blow his blast
42362 Particularities and petty sounds
42363 To cease Wast thou ordain'd dear father
42364 To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
42365 The silver livery of advised age
42366 And in thy reverence and thy chairdays thus
42367 To die in ruffian battle Even at this sight
42368 My heart is turn'd to stone and while 'tis mine
42369 It shall be stony York not our old men spares
42370 No more will I their babes Tears virginal
42371 Shall be to me even as the dew to fire
42372 And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
42373 Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
42374 Henceforth I will not have to do with pity
42375 Meet I an infant of the house of York
42376 Into as many gobbets will I cut it
42377 As wild Medea young Absyrtus did
42378 In cruelty will I seek out my fame
42379 Come thou new ruin of old Clifford's house
42380 As did Aeneas old Anchises bear
42381 So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders

42400 If you be ta'en we then should see the bottom
42401 Of all our fortunes but if we haply scape
42402 As well we may if not through your neglect

42405 May readily be stopp'd

42423 Is not itself nor have we won one foot
42424 If Salisbury be lost
42425 RICHARD My noble father
42426 Three times today I holp him to his horse
42427 Three times bestrid him thrice I led him off
42428 Persuaded him from any further act

42430 And like rich hangings in a homely house
42431 So was his will in his old feeble body
42432 But noble as he is look where he comes
42433 Enter SALISBURY
42434 SALISBURY Now by my sword well hast thou fought today
42435 By th mass so did we all I thank you Richard

42438 You have defended me from imminent death

42440 'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled
42441 Being opposites of such repairing nature

42447 WARWICK After them Nay before them if we can

42509 WARWICK I wonder how the King escap'd our hands
42510 YORK While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north
42511 He slily stole away and left his men
42512 Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland
42513 Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
42514 Cheer'd up the drooping army and himself
42515 Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast
42516 Charg'd our main battle's front and breaking in
42517 Were by the swords of common soldiers slain
42518 EDWARD Lord Stafford's father Duke of Buckingham
42519 Is either slain or wounded dangerous
42520 I cleft his beaver with a downright blow
42521 That this is true father behold his blood
42522 MONTAGUE And brother here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood
42523 Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd
42524 RICHARD Speak thou for me and tell them what I did
42525 [Throwing down SOMERSET'S head]
42526 YORK Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons
42527 But is your Grace dead my Lord of Somerset
42528 NORFOLK Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt
42529 RICHARD Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head
42530 WARWICK And so do I Victorious Prince of York
42531 Before I see thee seated in that throne
42532 Which now the house of Lancaster usurps
42533 I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
42534 This is the palace of the fearful King
42535 And this the regal seat Possess it York
42536 For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
42537 YORK Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will
42538 For hither we have broken in by force
42539 NORFOLK We'll all assist you he that flies shall die

42545 YORK The Queen this day here holds her parliament
42546 But little thinks we shall be of her council
42547 By words or blows here let us win our right
42548 RICHARD Arm'd as we are let's stay within this house
42549 WARWICK The bloody parliament shall this be call'd
42550 Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be King
42551 And bashful Henry depos'd whose cowardice
42552 Hath made us bywords to our enemies
42553 YORK Then leave me not my lords be resolute
42554 I mean to take possession of my right
42555 WARWICK Neither the King nor he that loves him best

42567 To aspire unto the crown and reign as king
42568 Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father
42569 And thine Lord Clifford and you both have vow'd revenge
42570 On him his sons his favourites and his friends

42606 And slew your fathers and with colours spread
42607 March'd through the city to the palace gates

42614 I send thee Warwick such a messenger
42615 As shall revenge his death before I stir
42616 WARWICK Poor Clifford how I scorn his worthless threats
42617 YORK Will you we show our title to the crown
42618 If not our swords shall plead it in the field
42619 KING HENRY What title hast thou traitor to the crown
42620 Thy father was as thou art Duke of York
42621 Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March
42622 I am the son of Henry the Fifth
42623 Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
42624 And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces
42625 WARWICK Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all
42626 KING HENRY The Lord Protector lost it and not I

42669 WARWICK Depos'd he shall be in despite of all
42670 NORTHUMBERLAND Thou art deceiv'd 'Tis not thy southern power
42671 Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent
42672 Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
42673 Can set the Duke up in despite of me
42674 CLIFFORD King Henry be thy title right or wrong
42675 Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence
42676 May that ground gape and swallow me alive

42679 YORK Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown
42680 What mutter you or what conspire you lords
42681 WARWICK Do right unto this princely Duke of York

42683 And over the chair of state where now he sits
42684 Write up his title with usurping blood
42685 [He stamps with his foot and the
42686 soldiers show themselves]
42687 KING HENRY My Lord of Warwick hear but one word
42688 Let me for this my lifetime reign as king

42703 And die in bands for this unmanly deed
42704 CLIFFORD In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome

42706 Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND CLIFFORD
42707 and WESTMORELAND
42708 WARWICK Turn this way Henry and regard them not
42709 EXETER They seek revenge and therefore will not yield
42710 KING HENRY Ah Exeter
42711 WARWICK Why should you sigh my lord
42712 KING HENRY Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son
42713 Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit
42714 But be it as it may [To YORK] I here entail
42715 The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
42716 Conditionally that here thou take an oath
42717 To cease this civil war and whilst I live

42738 QUEEN MARGARET Nay go not from me I will follow thee
42739 KING HENRY Be patient gentle queen and I will stay
42740 QUEEN MARGARET Who can be patient in such extremes
42741 Ah wretched man Would I had died a maid
42742 And never seen thee never borne thee son
42743 Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father
42744 Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus
42745 Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I
42746 Or felt that pain which I did for him once
42747 Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood
42748 Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
42749 Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir
42750 And disinherited thine only son
42751 PRINCE OF WALES Father you cannot disinherit me
42752 If you be King why should not I succeed
42753 KING HENRY Pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son

42755 QUEEN MARGARET Enforc'd thee Art thou King and wilt be
42756 forc'd
42757 I shame to hear thee speak Ah timorous wretch
42758 Thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
42759 And giv'n unto the house of York such head
42760 As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
42761 To entail him and his heirs unto the crown
42762 What is it but to make thy sepulchre
42763 And creep into it far before thy time
42764 Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais
42765 Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas
42766 The Duke is made Protector of the realm
42767 And yet shalt thou be safe Such safety finds
42768 The trembling lamb environed with wolves
42769 Had I been there which am a silly woman
42770 The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
42771 Before I would have granted to that act
42772 But thou prefer'st thy life before thine honour
42773 And seeing thou dost I here divorce myself
42774 Both from thy table Henry and thy bed
42775 Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
42776 Whereby my son is disinherited
42777 The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
42778 Will follow mine if once they see them spread
42779 And spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
42780 And utter ruin of the house of York

42794 Whose haughty spirit winged with desire
42795 Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
42796 Tire on the flesh of me and of my son
42797 The loss of those three lords torments my heart
42798 I'll write unto them and entreat them fair
42799 Come cousin you shall be the messenger

42817 By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe
42818 It will outrun you father in the end
42819 YORK I took an oath that he should quietly reign
42820 EDWARD But for a kingdom any oath may be broken
42821 I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
42822 RICHARD No God forbid your Grace should be forsworn
42823 YORK I shall be if I claim by open war
42824 RICHARD I'll prove the contrary if you'll hear me speak

42827 Before a true and lawful magistrate
42828 That hath authority over him that swears
42829 Henry had none but did usurp the place
42830 Then seeing 'twas he that made you to depose
42831 Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
42832 Therefore to arms And father do but think
42833 How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
42834 Within whose circuit is Elysium
42835 And all that poets feign of bliss and joy
42836 Why do we linger thus I cannot rest
42837 Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd
42838 Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart
42839 YORK Richard enough I will be King or die
42840 Brother thou shalt to London presently

42878 YORK Five men to twenty Though the odds be great

42883 SCENE III
42884 Field of battle between Sandal Castle and Wakefield
42885 Alarum Enter RUTLAND and his TUTOR
42886 RUTLAND Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands
42887 Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes
42888 Enter CLIFFORD and soldiers
42889 CLIFFORD Chaplain away Thy priesthood saves thy life
42890 As for the brat of this accursed duke
42891 Whose father slew my father he shall die
42892 TUTOR And I my lord will bear him company
42893 CLIFFORD Soldiers away with him
42894 TUTOR Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child
42895 Lest thou be hated both of God and man
42896 Exit forced off by soldiers
42897 CLIFFORD How now is he dead already Or is it fear
42898 That makes him close his eyes I'll open them
42899 RUTLAND So looks the pentup lion o'er the wretch
42900 That trembles under his devouring paws
42901 And so he walks insulting o'er his prey
42902 And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
42903 Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword
42904 And not with such a cruel threat'ning look
42905 Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die
42906 I am too mean a subject for thy wrath
42907 Be thou reveng'd on men and let me live
42908 CLIFFORD In vain thou speak'st poor boy my father's blood
42909 Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter
42910 RUTLAND Then let my father's blood open it again
42911 He is a man and Clifford cope with him
42912 CLIFFORD Had I thy brethren here their lives and thine
42913 Were not revenge sufficient for me
42914 No if I digg'd up thy forefathers graves
42915 And hung their rotten coffins up in chains
42916 It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
42917 The sight of any of the house of York
42918 Is as a fury to torment my soul
42919 And till I root out their accursed line
42920 And leave not one alive I live in hell
42921 Therefore
42922 RUTLAND O let me pray before I take my death
42923 To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me
42924 CLIFFORD Such pity as my rapier's point affords
42925 RUTLAND I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
42926 CLIFFORD Thy father hath
42927 RUTLAND But 'twas ere I was born
42928 Thou hast one son for his sake pity me
42929 Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just
42930 He be as miserably slain as I
42931 Ah let me live in prison all my days
42932 And when I give occasion of offence
42933 Then let me die for now thou hast no cause
42934 CLIFFORD No cause
42935 Thy father slew my father therefore die [Stabs him]
42936 RUTLAND Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae [Dies]
42937 CLIFFORD Plantagenet I come Plantagenet
42938 And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
42939 Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
42940 Congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both Exit
42941 SCENE IV
42942 Another part of the field
42943 Alarum Enter the DUKE OF YORK
42944 YORK The army of the Queen hath got the field
42945 My uncles both are slain in rescuing me
42946 And all my followers to the eager foe
42947 Turn back and fly like ships before the wind
42948 Or lambs pursu'd by hungerstarved wolves
42949 My sons God knows what hath bechanced them
42950 But this I know they have demean'd themselves
42951 Like men born to renown by life or death
42952 Three times did Richard make a lane to me
42953 And thrice cried 'Courage father fight it out'
42954 And full as oft came Edward to my side
42955 With purple falchion painted to the hilt
42956 In blood of those that had encount'red him
42957 And when the hardiest warriors did retire
42958 Richard cried 'Charge and give no foot of ground'
42959 And cried 'A crown or else a glorious tomb
42960 A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre'
42961 With this we charg'd again but out alas
42962 We bodg'd again as I have seen a swan
42963 With bootless labour swim against the tide
42964 And spend her strength with overmatching waves
42965 [A short alarum within]
42966 Ah hark The fatal followers do pursue
42967 And I am faint and cannot fly their fury
42968 And were I strong I would not shun their fury
42969 The sands are numb'red that make up my life
42970 Here must I stay and here my life must end
42971 Enter QUEEN MARGARET CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND
42972 the PRINCE OF WALES and soldiers
42973 Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland
42974 I dare your quenchless fury to more rage
42975 I am your butt and I abide your shot
42976 NORTHUMBERLAND Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet
42977 CLIFFORD Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
42978 With downright payment show'd unto my father
42979 Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car
42980 And made an evening at the noontide prick
42981 YORK My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
42982 A bird that will revenge upon you all
42983 And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
42984 Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with
42985 Why come you not What multitudes and fear
42986 CLIFFORD So cowards fight when they can fly no further
42987 So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons
42988 So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
42989 Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers
42990 YORK O Clifford but bethink thee once again
42991 And in thy thought o'errun my former time
42992 And if thou canst for blushing view this face
42993 And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
42994 Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
42995 CLIFFORD I will not bandy with thee word for word
42996 But buckler with thee blows twice two for one
42997 QUEEN MARGARET Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes
42998 I would prolong awhile the traitor's life
42999 Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland
43000 NORTHUMBERLAND Hold Clifford do not honour him so much
43001 To prick thy finger though to wound his heart
43002 What valour were it when a cur doth grin
43003 For one to thrust his hand between his teeth
43004 When he might spurn him with his foot away
43005 It is war's prize to take all vantages
43006 And ten to one is no impeach of valour
43007 [They lay hands on YORK who struggles]
43008 CLIFFORD Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
43009 NORTHUMBERLAND So doth the cony struggle in the net
43010 YORK So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty
43011 So true men yield with robbers so o'ermatch'd
43012 NORTHUMBERLAND What would your Grace have done unto him now
43013 QUEEN MARGARET Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland
43014 Come make him stand upon this molehill here
43015 That raught at mountains with outstretched arms
43016 Yet parted but the shadow with his hand
43017 What was it you that would be England's king
43018 Was't you that revell'd in our parliament
43019 And made a preachment of your high descent
43020 Where are your mess of sons to back you now
43021 The wanton Edward and the lusty George
43022 And where's that valiant crookback prodigy
43023 Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
43024 Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
43025 Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland
43026 Look York I stain'd this napkin with the blood
43027 That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point
43028 Made issue from the bosom of the boy
43029 And if thine eyes can water for his death
43030 I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
43031 Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly
43032 I should lament thy miserable state
43033 I prithee grieve to make me merry York
43034 What hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
43035 That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death
43036 Why art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad
43037 And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus
43038 Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
43039 Thou wouldst be fee'd I see to make me sport
43040 York cannot speak unless he wear a crown
43041 A crown for Yorkand lords bow low to him
43042 Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on
43043 [Putting a paper crown on his head]
43044 Ay marry sir now looks he like a king
43045 Ay this is he that took King Henry's chair
43046 And this is he was his adopted heir
43047 But how is it that great Plantagenet
43048 Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath
43049 As I bethink me you should not be King
43050 Till our King Henry had shook hands with death
43051 And will you pale your head in Henry's glory
43052 And rob his temples of the diadem
43053 Now in his life against your holy oath
43054 O 'tis a fault too too
43055 Off with the crown and with the crown his head
43056 And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
43057 CLIFFORD That is my office for my father's sake
43058 QUEEN MARGARET Nay stay let's hear the orisons he makes
43059 YORK Shewolf of France but worse than wolves of France
43060 Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth
43061 How illbeseeming is it in thy sex
43062 To triumph like an Amazonian trull
43063 Upon their woes whom fortune captivates
43064 But that thy face is visardlike unchanging
43065 Made impudent with use of evil deeds
43066 I would assay proud queen to make thee blush
43067 To tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom deriv'd
43068 Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
43069 Thy father bears the type of King of Naples
43070 Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem
43071 Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman
43072 Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
43073 It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
43074 Unless the adage must be verified
43075 That beggars mounted run their horse to death
43076 'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
43077 But God He knows thy share thereof is small
43078 'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd
43079 The contrary doth make thee wond'red at
43080 'Tis government that makes them seem divine
43081 The want thereof makes thee abominable
43082 Thou art as opposite to every good
43083 As the Antipodes are unto us
43084 Or as the south to the septentrion
43085 O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide
43086 How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
43087 To bid the father wipe his eyes withal
43088 And yet be seen to bear a woman's face
43089 Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
43090 Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
43091 Bid'st thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish
43092 Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will
43093 For raging wind blows up incessant showers
43094 And when the rage allays the rain begins
43095 These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies
43096 And every drop cries vengeance for his death
43097 'Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman
43098 NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew me but his passions move me so
43099 That hardly can I check my eyes from tears
43100 YORK That face of his the hungry cannibals
43101 Would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood
43102 But you are more inhuman more inexorable
43103 O ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania
43104 See ruthless queen a hapless father's tears
43105 This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy
43106 And I with tears do wash the blood away
43107 Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
43108 And if thou tell'st the heavy story right
43109 Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
43110 Yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
43111 And say 'Alas it was a piteous deed'
43112 There take the crown and with the crown my curse
43113 And in thy need such comfort come to thee
43114 As now I reap at thy too cruel hand
43115 Hardhearted Clifford take me from the world
43116 My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
43117 NORTHUMBERLAND Had he been slaughterman to all my kin
43118 I should not for my life but weep with him
43119 To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
43120 QUEEN MARGARET What weepingripe my Lord Northumberland
43121 Think but upon the wrong he did us all
43122 And that will quickly dry thy melting tears
43123 CLIFFORD Here's for my oath here's for my father's death
43124 [Stabbing him]
43125 QUEEN MARGARET And here's to right our gentlehearted king
43126 [Stabbing him]
43127 YORK Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God
43128 My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee
43129 [Dies]
43130 QUEEN MARGARET Off with his head and set it on York gates
43131 So York may overlook the town of York

43141 ACT II SCENE I
43142 A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
43143 A march Enter EDWARD RICHARD and their power
43144 EDWARD I wonder how our princely father scap'd
43145 Or whether he be scap'd away or no
43146 From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit
43147 Had he been ta'en we should have heard the news
43148 Had he been slain we should have heard the news
43149 Or had he scap'd methinks we should have heard
43150 The happy tidings of his good escape
43151 How fares my brother Why is he so sad
43152 RICHARD I cannot joy until I be resolv'd
43153 Where our right valiant father is become
43154 I saw him in the battle range about
43155 And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth
43156 Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
43157 As doth a lion in a herd of neat
43158 Or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs
43159 Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry
43160 The rest stand all aloof and bark at him
43161 So far'd our father with his enemies
43162 So fled his enemies my warlike father
43163 Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son
43164 See how the morning opes her golden gates
43165 And takes her farewell of the glorious sun
43166 How well resembles it the prime of youth
43167 Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love
43168 EDWARD Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns
43169 RICHARD Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
43170 Not separated with the racking clouds
43171 But sever'd in a pale clearshining sky
43172 See see they join embrace and seem to kiss
43173 As if they vow'd some league inviolable
43174 Now are they but one lamp one light one sun
43175 In this the heaven figures some event
43176 EDWARD 'Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
43177 I think it cites us brother to the field
43178 That we the sons of brave Plantagenet
43179 Each one already blazing by our meeds
43180 Should notwithstanding join our lights together
43181 And overshine the earth as this the world
43182 Whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear
43183 Upon my target three fair shining suns
43184 RICHARD Nay bear three daughters by your leave I speak it
43185 You love the breeder better than the male
43186 Enter a MESSENGER blowing
43187 But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
43188 Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
43189 MESSENGER Ah one that was a woeful lookeron
43190 When as the noble Duke of York was slain
43191 Your princely father and my loving lord
43192 EDWARD O speak no more for I have heard too much
43193 RICHARD Say how he died for I will hear it all
43194 MESSENGER Environed he was with many foes
43195 And stood against them as the hope of Troy
43196 Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy
43197 But Hercules himself must yield to odds
43198 And many strokes though with a little axe
43199 Hews down and fells the hardesttimber'd oak
43200 By many hands your father was subdu'd
43201 But only slaught'red by the ireful arm
43202 Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen
43203 Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite
43204 Laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept
43205 The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks
43206 A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
43207 Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain
43208 And after many scorns many foul taunts
43209 They took his head and on the gates of York
43210 They set the same and there it doth remain
43211 The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd
43212 EDWARD Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon
43213 Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
43214 O Clifford boist'rous Clifford thou hast slain
43215 The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry
43216 And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
43217 For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee
43218 Now my soul's palace is become a prison
43219 Ah would she break from hence that this my body
43220 Might in the ground be closed up in rest
43221 For never henceforth shall I joy again
43222 Never O never shall I see more joy
43223 RICHARD I cannot weep for all my body's moisture
43224 Scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart
43225 Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden
43226 For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
43227 Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
43228 And burns me up with flames that tears would quench
43229 To weep is to make less the depth of grief
43230 Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
43231 Richard I bear thy name I'll venge thy death
43232 Or die renowned by attempting it
43233 EDWARD His name that valiant duke hath left with thee
43234 His dukedom and his chair with me is left
43235 RICHARD Nay if thou be that princely eagle's bird
43236 Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun
43237 For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
43238 Either that is thine or else thou wert not his
43239 March Enter WARWICK MONTAGUE and their army
43240 WARWICK How now fair lords What fare What news abroad
43241 RICHARD Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount
43242 Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance
43243 Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told
43244 The words would add more anguish than the wounds
43245 O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain
43246 EDWARD O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet
43247 Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption
43248 Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death
43249 WARWICK Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears
43250 And now to add more measure to your woes
43251 I come to tell you things sith then befall'n
43252 After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
43253 Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp
43254 Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
43255 Were brought me of your loss and his depart
43256 I then in London keeper of the King
43257 Muster'd my soldiers gathered flocks of friends
43258 And very well appointed as I thought
43259 March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen
43260 Bearing the King in my behalf along
43261 For by my scouts I was advertised
43262 That she was coming with a full intent
43263 To dash our late decree in parliament
43264 Touching King Henry's oath and your succession
43265 Short tale to make we at Saint Albans met
43266 Our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought
43267 But whether 'twas the coldness of the King
43268 Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen
43269 That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen
43270 Or whether 'twas report of her success
43271 Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour
43272 Who thunders to his captives blood and death
43273 I cannot judge but to conclude with truth
43274 Their weapons like to lightning came and went
43275 Our soldiers like the nightowl's lazy flight
43276 Or like an idle thresher with a flail
43277 Fell gently down as if they struck their friends
43278 I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
43279 With promise of high pay and great rewards
43280 But all in vain they had no heart to fight
43281 And we in them no hope to win the day
43282 So that we fled the King unto the Queen
43283 Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself
43284 In haste posthaste are come to join with you
43285 For in the marches here we heard you were
43286 Making another head to fight again
43287 EDWARD Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick
43288 And when came George from Burgundy to England
43289 WARWICK Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers
43290 And for your brother he was lately sent
43291 From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy
43292 With aid of soldiers to this needful war
43293 RICHARD 'Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled
43294 Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit
43295 But ne'er till now his scandal of retire
43296 WARWICK Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear
43297 For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
43298 Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head
43299 And wring the awful sceptre from his fist
43300 Were he as famous and as bold in war
43301 As he is fam'd for mildness peace and prayer
43302 RICHARD I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not
43303 'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak
43304 But in this troublous time what's to be done
43305 Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
43306 And wrap our bodies in black mourninggowns
43307 Numbering our AveMaries with our beads
43308 Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
43309 Tell our devotion with revengeful arms
43310 If for the last say 'Ay and to it lords
43311 WARWICK Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out
43312 And therefore comes my brother Montague
43313 Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen
43314 With Clifford and the haught Northumberland
43315 And of their feather many moe proud birds
43316 Have wrought the easymelting King like wax
43317 He swore consent to your succession
43318 His oath enrolled in the parliament
43319 And now to London all the crew are gone
43320 To frustrate both his oath and what beside
43321 May make against the house of Lancaster
43322 Their power I think is thirty thousand strong
43323 Now if the help of Norfolk and myself
43324 With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March
43325 Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure
43326 Will but amount to five and twenty thousand
43327 Why Via to London will we march amain
43328 And once again bestride our foaming steeds
43329 And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes'
43330 But never once again turn back and fly
43331 RICHARD Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
43332 Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
43333 That cries 'Retire if Warwick bid him stay
43334 EDWARD Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean
43335 And when thou fail'st as God forbid the hour
43336 Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend
43337 WARWICK No longer Earl of March but Duke of York
43338 The next degree is England's royal throne
43339 For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
43340 In every borough as we pass along
43341 And he that throws not up his cap for joy
43342 Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
43343 King Edward valiant Richard Montague
43344 Stay we no longer dreaming of renown
43345 But sound the trumpets and about our task
43346 RICHARD Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
43347 As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
43348 I come to pierce it or to give thee mine
43349 EDWARD Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us
43350 Enter a MESSENGER
43351 WARWICK How now what news
43352 MESSENGER The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
43353 The Queen is coming with a puissant host
43354 And craves your company for speedy counsel
43355 WARWICK Why then it sorts brave warriors let's away
43356 Exeunt
43357 SCENE II
43358 Before York
43359 Flourish Enter KING HENRY QUEEN MARGARET the PRINCE OF WALES CLIFFORD
43360 NORTHUMBERLAND with drum and trumpets
43361 QUEEN MARGARET Welcome my lord to this brave town of York
43362 Yonder's the head of that archenemy
43363 That sought to be encompass'd with your crown
43364 Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
43365 KING HENRY Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck
43366 To see this sight it irks my very soul
43367 Withhold revenge dear God 'tis not my fault
43368 Nor wittingly have I infring'd my vow
43369 CLIFFORD My gracious liege this too much lenity
43370 And harmful pity must be laid aside
43371 To whom do lions cast their gentle looks
43372 Not to the beast that would usurp their den
43373 Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
43374 Not his that spoils her young before her face
43375 Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting
43376 Not he that sets his foot upon her back
43377 The smallest worm will turn being trodden on
43378 And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
43379 Ambitious York did level at thy crown
43380 Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
43381 He but a Duke would have his son a king
43382 And raise his issue like a loving sire
43383 Thou being a king bless'd with a goodly son
43384 Didst yield consent to disinherit him
43385 Which argued thee a most unloving father
43386 Unreasonable creatures feed their young
43387 And though man's face be fearful to their eyes
43388 Yet in protection of their tender ones
43389 Who hath not seen them even with those wings
43390 Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight
43391 Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest
43392 Offering their own lives in their young's defence
43393 For shame my liege make them your precedent
43394 Were it not pity that this goodly boy
43395 Should lose his birthright by his father's fault
43396 And long hereafter say unto his child
43397 'What my greatgrandfather and grandsire got
43398 My careless father fondly gave away'
43399 Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy
43400 And let his manly face which promiseth
43401 Successful fortune steel thy melting heart
43402 To hold thine own and leave thine own with him
43403 KING HENRY Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator
43404 Inferring arguments of mighty force
43405 But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear
43406 That things ill got had ever bad success
43407 And happy always was it for that son
43408 Whose father for his hoarding went to hell
43409 I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
43410 And would my father had left me no more
43411 For all the rest is held at such a rate
43412 As brings a thousandfold more care to keep
43413 Than in possession any jot of pleasure
43414 Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know
43415 How it doth grieve me that thy head is here
43416 QUEEN MARGARET My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
43417 And this soft courage makes your followers faint
43418 You promis'd knighthood to our forward son
43419 Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
43420 Edward kneel down
43421 KING HENRY Edward Plantagenet arise a knight
43422 And learn this lesson Draw thy sword in right
43423 PRINCE OF WALES My gracious father by your kingly leave
43424 I'll draw it as apparent to the crown
43425 And in that quarrel use it to the death
43426 CLIFFORD Why that is spoken like a toward prince
43427 Enter a MESSENGER
43428 MESSENGER Royal commanders be in readiness
43429 For with a band of thirty thousand men
43430 Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York
43431 And in the towns as they do march along
43432 Proclaims him king and many fly to him
43433 Darraign your battle for they are at hand
43434 CLIFFORD I would your Highness would depart the field
43435 The Queen hath best success when you are absent
43436 QUEEN MARGARET Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
43437 KING HENRY Why that's my fortune too therefore I'll stay
43438 NORTHUMBERLAND Be it with resolution then to fight
43439 PRINCE OF WALES My royal father cheer these noble lords
43440 And hearten those that fight in your defence
43441 Unsheathe your sword good father cry 'Saint George'
43442 March Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD WARWICK
43443 NORFOLK MONTAGUE and soldiers
43444 EDWARD Now perjur'd Henry wilt thou kneel for grace
43445 And set thy diadem upon my head
43446 Or bide the mortal fortune of the field
43447 QUEEN MARGARET Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
43448 Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
43449 Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
43450 EDWARD I am his king and he should bow his knee
43451 I was adopted heir by his consent
43452 Since when his oath is broke for as I hear
43453 You that are King though he do wear the crown
43454 Have caus'd him by new act of parliament
43455 To blot out me and put his own son in
43456 CLIFFORD And reason too
43457 Who should succeed the father but the son
43458 RICHARD Are you there butcher O I cannot speak
43459 CLIFFORD Ay crookback here I stand to answer thee
43460 Or any he the proudest of thy sort
43461 RICHARD 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland was it not
43462 CLIFFORD Ay and old York and yet not satisfied
43463 RICHARD For God's sake lords give signal to the fight
43464 WARWICK What say'st thou Henry Wilt thou yield the crown
43465 QUEEN MARGARET Why how now longtongu'd Warwick Dare you speak
43466 When you and I met at Saint Albans last
43467 Your legs did better service than your hands
43468 WARWICK Then 'twas my turn to fly and now 'tis thine
43469 CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled
43470 WARWICK 'Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence
43471 NORTHUMBERLAND No nor your manhood that durst make you stay
43472 RICHARD Northumberland I hold thee reverently
43473 Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain
43474 The execution of my bigswol'n heart
43475 Upon that Clifford that cruel childkiller
43476 CLIFFORD I slew thy father call'st thou him a child
43477 RICHARD Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
43478 As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland
43479 But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed
43480 KING HENRY Have done with words my lords and hear me speak
43481 QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then or else hold close thy lips
43482 KING HENRY I prithee give no limits to my tongue
43483 I am a king and privileg'd to speak
43484 CLIFFORD My liege the wound that bred this meeting here
43485 Cannot be cur'd by words therefore be still
43486 RICHARD Then executioner unsheathe thy sword
43487 By Him that made us all I am resolv'd
43488 That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue
43489 EDWARD Say Henry shall I have my right or no
43490 A thousand men have broke their fasts today
43491 That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown
43492 WARWICK If thou deny their blood upon thy head
43493 For York in justice puts his armour on
43494 PRINCE OF WALES If that be right which Warwick says is right
43495 There is no wrong but every thing is right
43496 RICHARD Whoever got thee there thy mother stands
43497 For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue
43498 QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
43499 But like a foul misshapen stigmatic
43500 Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided
43501 As venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
43502 RICHARD Iron of Naples hid with English gilt
43503 Whose father bears the title of a king
43504 As if a channel should be call'd the sea
43505 Sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
43506 To let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
43507 EDWARD A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
43508 To make this shameless callet know herself
43509 Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou
43510 Although thy husband may be Menelaus
43511 And ne'er was Agamemmon's brother wrong'd
43512 By that false woman as this king by thee
43513 His father revell'd in the heart of France
43514 And tam'd the King and made the Dauphin stoop
43515 And had he match'd according to his state
43516 He might have kept that glory to this day
43517 But when he took a beggar to his bed
43518 And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day
43519 Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him
43520 That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France
43521 And heap'd sedition on his crown at home
43522 For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride
43523 Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
43524 And we in pity of the gentle King
43525 Had slipp'd our claim until another age
43526 GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
43527 And that thy summer bred us no increase
43528 We set the axe to thy usurping root
43529 And though the edge hath something hit ourselves
43530 Yet know thou since we have begun to strike
43531 We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down
43532 Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods
43533 EDWARD And in this resolution I defy thee
43534 Not willing any longer conference
43535 Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak
43536 Sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
43537 And either victory or else a grave
43538 QUEEN MARGARET Stay Edward
43539 EDWARD No wrangling woman we'll no longer stay
43540 These words will cost ten thousand lives this day
43541 Exeunt
43542 SCENE III
43543 A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire
43544 Alarum excursions Enter WARWICK
43545 WARWICK Forspent with toil as runners with a race
43546 I lay me down a little while to breathe
43547 For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid
43548 Have robb'd my strongknit sinews of their strength
43549 And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile
43550 Enter EDWARD running
43551 EDWARD Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
43552 For this world frowns and Edward's sun is clouded
43553 WARWICK How now my lord What hap What hope of good
43554 Enter GEORGE
43555 GEORGE Our hap is lost our hope but sad despair
43556 Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
43557 What counsel give you Whither shall we fly
43558 EDWARD Bootless is flight they follow us with wings
43559 And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
43560 Enter RICHARD
43561 RICHARD Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
43562 Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
43563 Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance
43564 And in the very pangs of death he cried
43565 Like to a dismal clangor heard from far
43566 'Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death'
43567 So underneath the belly of their steeds
43568 That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood
43569 The noble gentleman gave up the ghost
43570 WARWICK Then let the earth be drunken with our blood
43571 I'll kill my horse because I will not fly
43572 Why stand we like softhearted women here
43573 Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
43574 And look upon as if the tragedy
43575 Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors
43576 Here on my knee I vow to God above
43577 I'll never pause again never stand still
43578 Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine
43579 Or fortune given me measure of revenge
43580 EDWARD O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine
43581 And in this vow do chain my soul to thine
43582 And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
43583 I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee
43584 Thou setterup and pluckerdown of kings
43585 Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands
43586 That to my foes this body must be prey
43587 Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
43588 And give sweet passage to my sinful soul
43589 Now lords take leave until we meet again
43590 Where'er it be in heaven or in earth
43591 RICHARD Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick
43592 Let me embrace thee in my weary arms
43593 I that did never weep now melt with woe
43594 That winter should cut off our springtime so
43595 WARWICK Away away Once more sweet lords farewell
43596 GEORGE Yet let us all together to our troops
43597 And give them leave to fly that will not stay
43598 And call them pillars that will stand to us
43599 And if we thrive promise them such rewards
43600 As victors wear at the Olympian games
43601 This may plant courage in their quailing breasts
43602 For yet is hope of life and victory
43603 Forslow no longer make we hence amain Exeunt
43604 SCENE IV
43605 Another part of the field
43606 Excursions Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD
43607 RICHARD Now Clifford I have singled thee alone
43608 Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York
43609 And this for Rutland both bound to revenge
43610 Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall
43611 CLIFFORD Now Richard I am with thee here alone
43612 This is the hand that stabbed thy father York
43613 And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland
43614 And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
43615 And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
43616 To execute the like upon thyself
43617 And so have at thee [They fight]
43618 Enter WARWICK CLIFFORD flies
43619 RICHARD Nay Warwick single out some other chase
43620 For I myself will hunt this wolf to death Exeunt
43621 SCENE V
43622 Another part of the field
43623 Alarum Enter KING HENRY alone
43624 KING HENRY This battle fares like to the morning's war
43625 When dying clouds contend with growing light
43626 What time the shepherd blowing of his nails
43627 Can neither call it perfect day nor night
43628 Now sways it this way like a mighty sea
43629 Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind
43630 Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
43631 Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind
43632 Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
43633 Now one the better then another best
43634 Both tugging to be victors breast to breast
43635 Yet neither conqueror nor conquered
43636 So is the equal poise of this fell war
43637 Here on this molehill will I sit me down
43638 To whom God will there be the victory
43639 For Margaret my queen and Clifford too
43640 Have chid me from the battle swearing both
43641 They prosper best of all when I am thence
43642 Would I were dead if God's good will were so
43643 For what is in this world but grief and woe
43644 O God methinks it were a happy life
43645 To be no better than a homely swain
43646 To sit upon a hill as I do now
43647 To carve out dials quaintly point by point
43648 Thereby to see the minutes how they run
43649 How many makes the hour full complete
43650 How many hours brings about the day
43651 How many days will finish up the year
43652 How many years a mortal man may live
43653 When this is known then to divide the times
43654 So many hours must I tend my flock
43655 So many hours must I take my rest
43656 So many hours must I contemplate
43657 So many hours must I sport myself
43658 So many days my ewes have been with young
43659 So many weeks ere the poor fools will can
43660 So many years ere I shall shear the fleece
43661 So minutes hours days months and years
43662 Pass'd over to the end they were created
43663 Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
43664 Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
43665 Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
43666 To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
43667 Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
43668 To kings that fear their subjects treachery
43669 O yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
43670 And to conclude the shepherd's homely curds
43671 His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
43672 His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
43673 All which secure and sweetly he enjoys
43674 Is far beyond a prince's delicates
43675 His viands sparkling in a golden cup
43676 His body couched in a curious bed
43677 When care mistrust and treason waits on him
43678 Alarum Enter a son that hath kill'd his Father at
43679 one door and a FATHER that hath kill'd his Son at
43680 another door
43681 SON Ill blows the wind that profits nobody
43682 This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
43683 May be possessed with some store of crowns
43684 And I that haply take them from him now
43685 May yet ere night yield both my life and them
43686 To some man else as this dead man doth me
43687 Who's this O God It is my father's face
43688 Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd
43689 O heavy times begetting such events
43690 From London by the King was I press'd forth
43691 My father being the Earl of Warwick's man
43692 Came on the part of York press'd by his master
43693 And I who at his hands receiv'd my life
43694 Have by my hands of life bereaved him
43695 Pardon me God I knew not what I did
43696 And pardon father for I knew not thee
43697 My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
43698 And no more words till they have flow'd their fill
43699 KING HENRY O piteous spectacle O bloody times
43700 Whiles lions war and battle for their dens
43701 Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
43702 Weep wretched man I'll aid thee tear for tear
43703 And let our hearts and eyes like civil war
43704 Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief
43705 Enter FATHER bearing of his SON
43706 FATHER Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me
43707 Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
43708 For I have bought it with an hundred blows
43709 But let me see Is this our foeman's face
43710 Ah no no no no it is mine only son
43711 Ah boy if any life be left in thee
43712 Throw up thine eye See see what show'rs arise
43713 Blown with the windy tempest of my heart
43714 Upon thy wounds that kills mine eye and heart
43715 O pity God this miserable age
43716 What stratagems how fell how butcherly
43717 Erroneous mutinous and unnatural
43718 This deadly quarrel daily doth beget
43719 O boy thy father gave thee life too soon
43720 And hath bereft thee of thy life too late
43721 KING HENRY Woe above woe grief more than common grief
43722 O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
43723 O pity pity gentle heaven pity
43724 The red rose and the white are on his face
43725 The fatal colours of our striving houses
43726 The one his purple blood right well resembles
43727 The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
43728 Wither one rose and let the other flourish
43729 If you contend a thousand lives must perish
43730 SON How will my mother for a father's death
43731 Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied
43732 FATHER How will my wife for slaughter of my son
43733 Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied
43734 KING HENRY How will the country for these woeful chances
43735 Misthink the King and not be satisfied
43736 SON Was ever son so rued a father's death
43737 FATHER Was ever father so bemoan'd his son
43738 KING HENRY Was ever king so griev'd for subjects woe
43739 Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
43740 SON I'll bear thee hence where I may weep my fill
43741 Exit with the body
43742 FATHER These arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
43743 My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
43744 For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go
43745 My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
43746 And so obsequious will thy father be
43747 Even for the loss of thee having no more
43748 As Priam was for all his valiant sons
43749 I'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will
43750 For I have murdered where I should not kill
43751 Exit with the body
43752 KING HENRY Sadhearted men much overgone with care
43753 Here sits a king more woeful than you are
43754 Alarums excursions Enter QUEEN MARGARET
43755 PRINCE OF WALES and EXETER
43756 PRINCE OF WALES Fly father fly for all your friends are fled
43757 And Warwick rages like a chafed bull
43758 Away for death doth hold us in pursuit
43759 QUEEN MARGARET Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain
43760 Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds
43761 Having the fearful flying hare in sight
43762 With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
43763 And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands
43764 Are at our backs and therefore hence amain
43765 EXETER Away for vengeance comes along with them
43766 Nay stay not to expostulate make speed
43767 Or else come after I'll away before
43768 KING HENRY Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter
43769 Not that I fear to stay but love to go
43770 Whither the Queen intends Forward away Exeunt
43771 SCENE VI
43772 Another part of the field
43773 A loud alarum Enter CLIFFORD wounded
43774 CLIFFORD Here burns my candle out ay here it dies
43775 Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light
43776 O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow
43777 More than my body's parting with my soul
43778 My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee
43779 And now I fall thy tough commixture melts
43780 Impairing Henry strength'ning misproud York
43781 The common people swarm like summer flies
43782 And whither fly the gnats but to the sun
43783 And who shines now but Henry's enemies
43784 O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent
43785 That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds
43786 Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth
43787 And Henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do
43788 Or as thy father and his father did
43789 Giving no ground unto the house of York
43790 They never then had sprung like summer flies
43791 I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
43792 Had left no mourning widows for our death
43793 And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
43794 For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
43795 And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
43796 Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
43797 No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
43798 The foe is merciless and will not pity
43799 For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity
43800 The air hath got into my deadly wounds
43801 And much effuse of blood doth make me faint
43802 Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest
43803 I stabb'd your fathers bosoms split my breast
43804 [He faints]
43805 Alarum and retreat Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD
43806 MONTAGUE WARWICK and soldiers
43807 EDWARD Now breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause
43808 And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
43809 Some troops pursue the bloodyminded Queen
43810 That led calm Henry though he were a king
43811 As doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust
43812 Command an argosy to stern the waves
43813 But think you lords that Clifford fled with them
43814 WARWICK No 'tis impossible he should escape
43815 For though before his face I speak the words
43816 Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave
43817 And whereso'er he is he's surely dead
43818 [CLIFFORD groans and dies]
43819 RICHARD Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
43820 A deadly groan like life and death's departing
43821 See who it is
43822 EDWARD And now the battle's ended
43823 If friend or foe let him be gently used
43824 RICHARD Revoke that doom of mercy for 'tis Clifford
43825 Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
43826 In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
43827 But set his murd'ring knife unto the root
43828 From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
43829 I mean our princely father Duke of York
43830 WARWICK From off the gates of York fetch down the head
43831 Your father's head which Clifford placed there
43832 Instead whereof let this supply the room
43833 Measure for measure must be answered
43834 EDWARD Bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
43835 That nothing sung but death to us and ours
43836 Now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound
43837 And his illboding tongue no more shall speak
43838 WARWICK I think his understanding is bereft
43839 Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
43840 Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
43841 And he nor sees nor hears us what we say
43842 RICHARD O would he did and so perhaps he doth
43843 'Tis but his policy to counterfeit
43844 Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
43845 Which in the time of death he gave our father
43846 GEORGE If so thou think'st vex him with eager words
43847 RICHARD Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
43848 EDWARD Clifford repent in bootless penitence
43849 WARWICK Clifford devise excuses for thy faults
43850 GEORGE While we devise fell tortures for thy faults
43851 RICHARD Thou didst love York and I am son to York
43852 EDWARD Thou pitied'st Rutland I will pity thee
43853 GEORGE Where's Captain Margaret to fence you now
43854 WARWICK They mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont
43855 RICHARD What not an oath Nay then the world goes hard
43856 When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
43857 I know by that he's dead and by my soul
43858 If this right hand would buy two hours life
43859 That I in all despite might rail at him
43860 This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood
43861 Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
43862 York and young Rutland could not satisfy
43863 WARWICK Ay but he's dead Off with the traitor's head
43864 And rear it in the place your father's stands
43865 And now to London with triumphant march
43866 There to be crowned England's royal King
43867 From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
43868 And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
43869 So shalt thou sinew both these lands together
43870 And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread
43871 The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again
43872 For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
43873 Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
43874 First will I see the coronation
43875 And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea
43876 To effect this marriage so it please my lord
43877 EDWARD Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be
43878 For in thy shoulder do I build my seat
43879 And never will I undertake the thing
43880 Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
43881 Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester
43882 And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself
43883 Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
43884 RICHARD Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester
43885 For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous
43886 WARWICK Tut that's a foolish observation
43887 Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London
43888 To see these honours in possession Exeunt

43897 ACT III SCENE I
43898 A chase in the north of England
43899 Enter two KEEPERS with crossbows in their hands
43900 FIRST KEEPER Under this thickgrown brake we'll shroud ourselves
43901 For through this laund anon the deer will come
43902 And in this covert will we make our stand
43903 Culling the principal of all the deer
43904 SECOND KEEPER I'll stay above the hill so both may shoot
43905 FIRST KEEPER That cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
43906 Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
43907 Here stand we both and aim we at the best
43908 And for the time shall not seem tedious
43909 I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
43910 In this selfplace where now we mean to stand
43911 SECOND KEEPER Here comes a man let's stay till he be past
43912 Enter KING HENRY disguised with a prayerbook
43913 KING HENRY From Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love
43914 To greet mine own land with my wishful sight
43915 No Harry Harry 'tis no land of thine
43916 Thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee
43917 Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed
43918 No bending knee will call thee Caesar now
43919 No humble suitors press to speak for right
43920 No not a man comes for redress of thee
43921 For how can I help them and not myself
43922 FIRST KEEPER Ay here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee
43923 This is the quondam King let's seize upon him
43924 KING HENRY Let me embrace thee sour adversity
43925 For wise men say it is the wisest course
43926 SECOND KEEPER Why linger we let us lay hands upon him
43927 FIRST KEEPER Forbear awhile we'll hear a little more
43928 KING HENRY My Queen and son are gone to France for aid
43929 And as I hear the great commanding Warwick
43930 Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister
43931 To wife for Edward If this news be true
43932 Poor queen and son your labour is but lost
43933 For Warwick is a subtle orator
43934 And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words
43935 By this account then Margaret may win him
43936 For she's a woman to be pitied much
43937 Her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast
43938 Her tears will pierce into a marble heart
43939 The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
43940 And Nero will be tainted with remorse
43941 To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
43942 Ay but she's come to beg Warwick to give
43943 She on his left side craving aid for Henry
43944 He on his right asking a wife for Edward
43945 She weeps and says her Henry is depos'd
43946 He smiles and says his Edward is install'd
43947 That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
43948 Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
43949 Inferreth arguments of mighty strength
43950 And in conclusion wins the King from her
43951 With promise of his sister and what else
43952 To strengthen and support King Edward's place
43953 O Margaret thus 'twill be and thou poor soul
43954 Art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn
43955 SECOND KEEPER Say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens
43956 KING HENRY More than I seem and less than I was born to
43957 A man at least for less I should not be
43958 And men may talk of kings and why not I
43959 SECOND KEEPER Ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king
43960 KING HENRY Why so I am in mind and that's enough
43961 SECOND KEEPER But if thou be a king where is thy crown
43962 KING HENRY My crown is in my heart not on my head
43963 Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones
43964 Not to be seen My crown is call'd content
43965 A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
43966 SECOND KEEPER Well if you be a king crown'd with content
43967 Your crown content and you must be contented
43968 To go along with us for as we think
43969 You are the king King Edward hath depos'd
43970 And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
43971 Will apprehend you as his enemy
43972 KING HENRY But did you never swear and break an oath
43973 SECOND KEEPER No never such an oath nor will not now
43974 KING HENRY Where did you dwell when I was King of England
43975 SECOND KEEPER Here in this country where we now remain
43976 KING HENRY I was anointed king at nine months old
43977 My father and my grandfather were kings
43978 And you were sworn true subjects unto me
43979 And tell me then have you not broke your oaths
43980 FIRST KEEPER No
43981 For we were subjects but while you were king
43982 KING HENRY Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man
43983 Ah simple men you know not what you swear
43984 Look as I blow this feather from my face
43985 And as the air blows it to me again
43986 Obeying with my wind when I do blow
43987 And yielding to another when it blows
43988 Commanded always by the greater gust
43989 Such is the lightness of you common men
43990 But do not break your oaths for of that sin
43991 My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
43992 Go where you will the King shall be commanded
43993 And be you kings command and I'll obey
43994 FIRST KEEPER We are true subjects to the King King Edward
43995 KING HENRY So would you be again to Henry
43996 If he were seated as King Edward is
43997 FIRST KEEPER We charge you in God's name and the King's
43998 To go with us unto the officers
43999 KING HENRY In God's name lead your King's name be obey'd
44000 And what God will that let your King perform
44001 And what he will I humbly yield unto Exeunt

44010 SCENE II
44011 London The palace
44012 Enter KING EDWARD GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and LADY GREY
44013 KING EDWARD Brother of Gloucester at Saint Albans field
44014 This lady's husband Sir Richard Grey was slain
44015 His land then seiz'd on by the conqueror
44016 Her suit is now to repossess those lands
44017 Which we in justice cannot well deny
44018 Because in quarrel of the house of York
44019 The worthy gentleman did lose his life
44020 GLOUCESTER Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit
44021 It were dishonour to deny it her
44022 KING EDWARD It were no less but yet I'll make a pause
44023 GLOUCESTER [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea is it so
44024 I see the lady hath a thing to grant
44025 Before the King will grant her humble suit
44026 CLARENCE [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game how true he
44027 keeps the wind
44028 GLOUCESTER [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence

44035 lands

44037 Fight closer or good faith you'll catch a blow
44038 CLARENCE [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not unless she chance
44039 to fall
44040 GLOUCESTER [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that for he'll take
44041 vantages
44042 KING EDWARD How many children hast thou widow tell me
44043 CLARENCE [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of
44044 her
44045 GLOUCESTER [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay then whip me he'll rather
44046 give her two
44047 LADY GREY Three my most gracious lord
44048 GLOUCESTER [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him
44049 KING EDWARD 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands
44050 LADY GREY Be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
44051 KING EDWARD Lords give us leave I'll try this widow's wit
44052 GLOUCESTER [Aside] Ay good leave have you for you will have
44053 leave
44054 Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch
44055 [GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE withdraw]
44056 KING EDWARD Now tell me madam do you love your children
44057 LADY GREY Ay full as dearly as I love myself
44058 KING EDWARD And would you not do much to do them good
44059 LADY GREY To do them good I would sustain some harm
44060 KING EDWARD Then get your husband's lands to do them good
44061 LADY GREY Therefore I came unto your Majesty
44062 KING EDWARD I'll tell you how these lands are to be got
44063 LADY GREY So shall you bind me to your Highness service
44064 KING EDWARD What service wilt thou do me if I give them
44065 LADY GREY What you command that rests in me to do
44066 KING EDWARD But you will take exceptions to my boon
44067 LADY GREY No gracious lord except I cannot do it
44068 KING EDWARD Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask
44069 LADY GREY Why then I will do what your Grace commands
44070 GLOUCESTER He plies her hard and much rain wears the marble
44071 CLARENCE As red as fire Nay then her wax must melt
44072 LADY GREY Why stops my lord Shall I not hear my task
44073 KING EDWARD An easy task 'tis but to love a king
44074 LADY GREY That's soon perform'd because I am a subject
44075 KING EDWARD Why then thy husband's lands I freely give thee
44076 LADY GREY I take my leave with many thousand thanks
44077 GLOUCESTER The match is made she seals it with a curtsy
44078 KING EDWARD But stay thee 'tis the fruits of love I mean
44079 LADY GREY The fruits of love I mean my loving liege
44080 KING EDWARD Ay but I fear me in another sense
44081 What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get
44082 LADY GREY My love till death my humble thanks my prayers
44083 That love which virtue begs and virtue grants
44084 KING EDWARD No by my troth I did not mean such love
44085 LADY GREY Why then you mean not as I thought you did
44086 KING EDWARD But now you partly may perceive my mind
44087 LADY GREY My mind will never grant what I perceive
44088 Your Highness aims at if I aim aright
44089 KING EDWARD To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee
44090 LADY GREY To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison
44091 KING EDWARD Why then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands
44092 LADY GREY Why then mine honesty shall be my dower
44093 For by that loss I will not purchase them
44094 KING EDWARD Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily
44095 LADY GREY Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me
44096 But mighty lord this merry inclination
44097 Accords not with the sadness of my suit
44098 Please you dismiss me either with ay or no
44099 KING EDWARD Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
44100 No if thou dost say no to my demand
44101 LADY GREY Then no my lord My suit is at an end
44102 GLOUCESTER The widow likes him not she knits her brows
44103 CLARENCE He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom
44104 KING EDWARD [Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty
44105 Her words doth show her wit incomparable
44106 All her perfections challenge sovereignty
44107 One way or other she is for a king
44108 And she shall be my love or else my queen
44109 Say that King Edward take thee for his queen
44110 LADY GREY 'Tis better said than done my gracious lord
44111 I am a subject fit to jest withal
44112 But far unfit to be a sovereign
44113 KING EDWARD Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee
44114 I speak no more than what my soul intends
44115 And that is to enjoy thee for my love
44116 LADY GREY And that is more than I will yield unto
44117 I know I am too mean to be your queen
44118 And yet too good to be your concubine
44119 KING EDWARD You cavil widow I did mean my queen
44120 LADY GREY 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father
44121 KING EDWARDNo more than when my daughters call thee mother
44122 Thou art a widow and thou hast some children
44123 And by God's Mother I being but a bachelor
44124 Have other some Why 'tis a happy thing
44125 To be the father unto many sons
44126 Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
44127 GLOUCESTER The ghostly father now hath done his shrift
44128 CLARENCE When he was made a shriver 'twas for shrift
44129 KING EDWARD Brothers you muse what chat we two have had
44130 GLOUCESTER The widow likes it not for she looks very sad
44131 KING EDWARD You'd think it strange if I should marry her
44132 CLARENCE To who my lord
44133 KING EDWARD Why Clarence to myself
44134 GLOUCESTER That would be ten days wonder at the least
44135 CLARENCE That's a day longer than a wonder lasts
44136 GLOUCESTER By so much is the wonder in extremes
44137 KING EDWARD Well jest on brothers I can tell you both
44138 Her suit is granted for her husband's lands
44139 Enter a NOBLEMAN
44140 NOBLEMAN My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken
44141 And brought your prisoner to your palace gate
44142 KING EDWARD See that he be convey'd unto the Tower
44143 And go we brothers to the man that took him
44144 To question of his apprehension
44145 Widow go you along Lords use her honourably
44146 Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
44147 GLOUCESTER Ay Edward will use women honourably
44148 Would he were wasted marrow bones and all
44149 That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
44150 To cross me from the golden time I look for
44151 And yet between my soul's desire and me
44152 The lustful Edward's title buried
44153 Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward
44154 And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies
44155 To take their rooms ere I can place myself
44156 A cold premeditation for my purpose
44157 Why then I do but dream on sovereignty
44158 Like one that stands upon a promontory
44159 And spies a faroff shore where he would tread
44160 Wishing his foot were equal with his eye
44161 And chides the sea that sunders him from thence
44162 Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way
44163 So do I wish the crown being so far off
44164 And so I chide the means that keeps me from it
44165 And so I say I'll cut the causes off
44166 Flattering me with impossibilities
44167 My eye's too quick my heart o'erweens too much
44168 Unless my hand and strength could equal them
44169 Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard
44170 What other pleasure can the world afford
44171 I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
44172 And deck my body in gay ornaments
44173 And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
44174 O miserable thought and more unlikely
44175 Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
44176 Why love forswore me in my mother's womb
44177 And for I should not deal in her soft laws
44178 She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
44179 To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub
44180 To make an envious mountain on my back
44181 Where sits deformity to mock my body
44182 To shape my legs of an unequal size
44183 To disproportion me in every part
44184 Like to a chaos or an unlick'd bearwhelp
44185 That carries no impression like the dam
44186 And am I then a man to be belov'd
44187 O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
44188 Then since this earth affords no joy to me
44189 But to command to check to o'erbear such
44190 As are of better person than myself
44191 I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown
44192 And whiles I live t account this world but hell
44193 Until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head
44194 Be round impaled with a glorious crown
44195 And yet I know not how to get the crown
44196 For many lives stand between me and home
44197 And I like one lost in a thorny wood
44198 That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns
44199 Seeking a way and straying from the way
44200 Not knowing how to find the open air
44201 But toiling desperately to find it out
44202 Torment myself to catch the English crown
44203 And from that torment I will free myself
44204 Or hew my way out with a bloody axe
44205 Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile
44206 And cry 'Content to that which grieves my heart
44207 And wet my cheeks with artificial tears
44208 And frame my face to all occasions
44209 I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
44210 I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk
44211 I'll play the orator as well as Nestor
44212 Deceive more slily than Ulysses could
44213 And like a Sinon take another Troy
44214 I can add colours to the chameleon
44215 Change shapes with Protheus for advantages
44216 And set the murderous Machiavel to school
44217 Can I do this and cannot get a crown
44218 Tut were it farther off I'll pluck it down Exit
44219 SCENE III
44220 France The KING'S palace
44221 Flourish Enter LEWIS the French King his sister BONA
44222 his Admiral call'd BOURBON PRINCE EDWARD QUEEN MARGARET
44223 and the EARL of OXFORD LEWIS sits and riseth up again
44224 LEWIS Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret
44225 Sit down with us It ill befits thy state
44226 And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit
44227 QUEEN MARGARET No mighty King of France Now Margaret
44228 Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve
44229 Where kings command I was I must confess
44230 Great Albion's Queen in former golden days
44231 But now mischance hath trod my title down
44232 And with dishonour laid me on the ground
44233 Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
44234 And to my humble seat conform myself
44235 LEWIS Why say fair Queen whence springs this deep despair
44236 QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
44237 And stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares
44238 LEWIS Whate'er it be be thou still like thyself
44239 And sit thee by our side [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck
44240 To fortune's yoke but let thy dauntless mind
44241 Still ride in triumph over all mischance
44242 Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief
44243 It shall be eas'd if France can yield relief
44244 QUEEN MARGARET Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
44245 And give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
44246 Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis
44247 That Henry sole possessor of my love
44248 Is of a king become a banish'd man
44249 And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn
44250 While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
44251 Usurps the regal title and the seat
44252 Of England's trueanointed lawful King
44253 This is the cause that I poor Margaret
44254 With this my son Prince Edward Henry's heir
44255 Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
44256 And if thou fail us all our hope is done
44257 Scotland hath will to help but cannot help
44258 Our people and our peers are both misled
44259 Our treasure seiz'd our soldiers put to flight
44260 And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
44261 LEWIS Renowned Queen with patience calm the storm
44262 While we bethink a means to break it off
44263 QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay the stronger grows our foe
44264 LEWIS The more I stay the more I'll succour thee
44265 QUEEN MARGARET O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
44266 And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
44267 Enter WARWICK
44268 LEWIS What's he approacheth boldly to our presence
44269 QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick Edward's greatest friend
44270 LEWIS Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France
44271 [He descends She ariseth]
44272 QUEEN MARGARET Ay now begins a second storm to rise
44273 For this is he that moves both wind and tide
44274 WARWICK From worthy Edward King of Albion
44275 My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
44276 I come in kindness and unfeigned love
44277 First to do greetings to thy royal person
44278 And then to crave a league of amity
44279 And lastly to confirm that amity
44280 With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
44281 That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister
44282 To England's King in lawful marriage
44283 QUEEN MARGARET [Aside] If that go forward Henry's hope is done
44284 WARWICK [To BONA] And gracious madam in our king's behalf
44285 I am commanded with your leave and favour
44286 Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
44287 To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart
44288 Where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears
44289 Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue
44290 QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak
44291 Before you answer Warwick His demand
44292 Springs not from Edward's wellmeant honest love
44293 But from deceit bred by necessity
44294 For how can tyrants safely govern home
44295 Unless abroad they purchase great alliance
44296 To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
44297 That Henry liveth still but were he dead
44298 Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henry's son
44299 Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage
44300 Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
44301 For though usurpers sway the rule a while
44302 Yet heav'ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs
44303 WARWICK Injurious Margaret
44304 PRINCE OF WALES And why not Queen
44305 WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp
44306 And thou no more art prince than she is queen
44307 OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
44308 Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain
44309 And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth
44310 Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
44311 And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth
44312 Who by his prowess conquered all France
44313 From these our Henry lineally descends
44314 WARWICK Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
44315 You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
44316 All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten
44317 Methinks these peers of France should smile at that
44318 But for the rest you tell a pedigree
44319 Of threescore and two years a silly time
44320 To make prescription for a kingdom's worth
44321 OXFORD Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
44322 Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years
44323 And not betray thy treason with a blush
44324 WARWICK Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
44325 Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
44326 For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king
44327 OXFORD Call him my king by whose injurious doom
44328 My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere
44329 Was done to death and more than so my father
44330 Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years
44331 When nature brought him to the door of death
44332 No Warwick no while life upholds this arm
44333 This arm upholds the house of Lancaster
44334 WARWICK And I the house of York
44335 LEWIS Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford
44336 Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
44337 While I use further conference with Warwick
44338 [They stand aloof]
44339 QUEEN MARGARET Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not
44340 LEWIS Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
44341 Is Edward your true king for I were loath
44342 To link with him that were not lawful chosen
44343 WARWICK Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour
44344 LEWIS But is he gracious in the people's eye
44345 WARWICK The more that Henry was unfortunate
44346 LEWIS Then further all dissembling set aside
44347 Tell me for truth the measure of his love
44348 Unto our sister Bona
44349 WARWICK Such it seems
44350 As may beseem a monarch like himself
44351 Myself have often heard him say and swear
44352 That this his love was an eternal plant
44353 Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground
44354 The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun
44355 Exempt from envy but not from disdain
44356 Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain
44357 LEWIS Now sister let us hear your firm resolve
44358 BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine
44359 [To WARWICK] Yet I confess that often ere this day
44360 When I have heard your king's desert recounted
44361 Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
44362 LEWIS Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edward's
44363 And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
44364 Touching the jointure that your king must make
44365 Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd
44366 Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness
44367 That Bona shall be wife to the English king
44368 PRINCE OF WALES To Edward but not to the English king
44369 QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick it was thy device
44370 By this alliance to make void my suit
44371 Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend
44372 LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret
44373 But if your title to the crown be weak
44374 As may appear by Edward's good success
44375 Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd
44376 From giving aid which late I promised
44377 Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
44378 That your estate requires and mine can yield
44379 WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his case
44380 Where having nothing nothing can he lose
44381 And as for you yourself our quondam queen
44382 You have a father able to maintain you
44383 And better 'twere you troubled him than France
44384 QUEEN MARGARET Peace impudent and shameless Warwick
44385 Proud setter up and puller down of kings
44386 I will not hence till with my talk and tears
44387 Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold
44388 Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love
44389 For both of you are birds of selfsame feather
44390 [POST blowing a horn within]
44391 LEWIS Warwick this is some post to us or thee
44392 Enter the POST
44393 POST My lord ambassador these letters are for you
44394 Sent from your brother Marquis Montague
44395 These from our King unto your Majesty
44396 And madam these for you from whom I know not
44397 [They all read their letters]
44398 OXFORD I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
44399 Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his
44400 PRINCE OF WALES Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled
44401 I hope all's for the best
44402 LEWIS Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen
44403 QUEEN MARGARET Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys
44404 WARWICK Mine full of sorrow and heart's discontent
44405 LEWIS What has your king married the Lady Grey
44406 And now to soothe your forgery and his
44407 Sends me a paper to persuade me patience
44408 Is this th alliance that he seeks with France
44409 Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
44410 QUEEN MARGARET I told your Majesty as much before
44411 This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty
44412 WARWICK King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven
44413 And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss
44414 That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's
44415 No more my king for he dishonours me
44416 But most himself if he could see his shame
44417 Did I forget that by the house of York
44418 My father came untimely to his death
44419 Did I let pass th abuse done to my niece
44420 Did I impale him with the regal crown
44421 Did I put Henry from his native right
44422 And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame
44423 Shame on himself for my desert is honour
44424 And to repair my honour lost for him
44425 I here renounce him and return to Henry
44426 My noble Queen let former grudges pass
44427 And henceforth I am thy true servitor
44428 I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
44429 And replant Henry in his former state
44430 QUEEN MARGARET Warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love
44431 And I forgive and quite forget old faults
44432 And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend
44433 WARWICK So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
44434 That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
44435 With some few bands of chosen soldiers
44436 I'll undertake to land them on our coast
44437 And force the tyrant from his seat by war
44438 'Tis not his newmade bride shall succour him
44439 And as for Clarence as my letters tell me
44440 He's very likely now to fall from him
44441 For matching more for wanton lust than honour
44442 Or than for strength and safety of our country
44443 BONA Dear brother how shall Bona be reveng'd
44444 But by thy help to this distressed queen
44445 QUEEN MARGARET Renowned Prince how shall poor Henry live
44446 Unless thou rescue him from foul despair
44447 BONA My quarrel and this English queen's are one
44448 WARWICK And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours
44449 LEWIS And mine with hers and thine and Margaret's
44450 Therefore at last I firmly am resolv'd
44451 You shall have aid
44452 QUEEN MARGARET Let me give humble thanks for all at once
44453 LEWIS Then England's messenger return in post
44454 And tell false Edward thy supposed king
44455 That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
44456 To revel it with him and his new bride
44457 Thou seest what's past go fear thy king withal
44458 BONA Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
44459 I'll wear the willowgarland for his sake
44460 QUEEN MARGARET Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
44461 And I am ready to put armour on
44462 WARWICK Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
44463 And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long
44464 There's thy reward be gone Exit POST
44465 LEWIS But Warwick
44466 Thou and Oxford with five thousand men
44467 Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle
44468 And as occasion serves this noble Queen
44469 And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply
44470 Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
44471 What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
44472 WARWICK This shall assure my constant loyalty
44473 That if our Queen and this young Prince agree
44474 I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
44475 To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
44476 QUEEN MARGARET Yes I agree and thank you for your motion
44477 Son Edward she is fair and virtuous
44478 Therefore delay not give thy hand to Warwick
44479 And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
44480 That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine
44481 PRINCE OF WALES Yes I accept her for she well deserves it
44482 And here to pledge my vow I give my hand
44483 [He gives his hand to WARWICK]
44484 LEWIS stay we now These soldiers shall be levied
44485 And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral
44486 Shall waft them over with our royal fleet
44487 I long till Edward fall by war's mischance
44488 For mocking marriage with a dame of France
44489 Exeunt all but WARWICK
44490 WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador
44491 But I return his sworn and mortal foe
44492 Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
44493 But dreadful war shall answer his demand
44494 Had he none else to make a stale but me
44495 Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow
44496 I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown
44497 And I'll be chief to bring him down again
44498 Not that I pity Henry's misery
44499 But seek revenge on Edward's mockery Exit

44509 London The palace
44510 Enter GLOUCESTER CLARENCE SOMERSET and MONTAGUE
44511 GLOUCESTER Now tell me brother Clarence what think you
44512 Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey
44513 Hath not our brother made a worthy choice
44514 CLARENCE Alas you know 'tis far from hence to France
44515 How could he stay till Warwick made return
44516 SOMERSET My lords forbear this talk here comes the King
44517 Flourish Enter KING EDWARD attended LADY
44518 GREY as Queen PEMBROKE STAFFORD HASTINGS
44519 and others Four stand on one side and four on the other
44520 GLOUCESTER And his wellchosen bride
44521 CLARENCE I mind to tell him plainly what I think
44522 KING EDWARD Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice
44523 That you stand pensive as half malcontent
44524 CLARENCE As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick
44525 Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
44526 That they'll take no offence at our abuse
44527 KING EDWARD Suppose they take offence without a cause
44528 They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward
44529 Your King and Warwick's and must have my will
44530 GLOUCESTER And shall have your will because our King
44531 Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
44532 KING EDWARD Yea brother Richard are you offended too
44533 GLOUCESTER Not I
44534 No God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
44535 Whom God hath join'd together ay and 'twere pity
44536 To sunder them that yoke so well together
44537 KING EDWARD Setting your scorns and your mislike aside
44538 Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
44539 Should not become my wife and England's Queen
44540 And you too Somerset and Montague
44541 Speak freely what you think
44542 CLARENCE Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis
44543 Becomes your enemy for mocking him
44544 About the marriage of the Lady Bona
44545 GLOUCESTER And Warwick doing what you gave in charge
44546 Is now dishonoured by this new marriage
44547 KING EDWARD What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd
44548 By such invention as I can devise
44549 MONTAGUE Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance
44550 Would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth
44551 'Gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage
44552 HASTINGS Why knows not Montague that of itself
44553 England is safe if true within itself
44554 MONTAGUE But the safer when 'tis back'd with France
44555 HASTINGS 'Tis better using France than trusting France
44556 Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
44557 Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable
44558 And with their helps only defend ourselves
44559 In them and in ourselves our safety lies
44560 CLARENCE For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
44561 To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford
44562 KING EDWARD Ay what of that it was my will and grant
44563 And for this once my will shall stand for law
44564 GLOUCESTER And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
44565 To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
44566 Unto the brother of your loving bride
44567 She better would have fitted me or Clarence
44568 But in your bride you bury brotherhood
44569 CLARENCE Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
44570 Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son
44571 And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
44572 KING EDWARD Alas poor Clarence Is it for a wife
44573 That thou art malcontent I will provide thee
44574 CLARENCE In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment
44575 Which being shallow you shall give me leave
44576 To play the broker in mine own behalf
44577 And to that end I shortly mind to leave you
44578 KING EDWARD Leave me or tarry Edward will be King
44579 And not be tied unto his brother's will
44580 QUEEN ELIZABETH My lords before it pleas'd his Majesty
44581 To raise my state to title of a queen
44582 Do me but right and you must all confess
44583 That I was not ignoble of descent
44584 And meaner than myself have had like fortune
44585 But as this title honours me and mine
44586 So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing
44587 Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
44588 KING EDWARD My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
44589 What danger or what sorrow can befall thee
44590 So long as Edward is thy constant friend
44591 And their true sovereign whom they must obey
44592 Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
44593 Unless they seek for hatred at my hands
44594 Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe
44595 And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
44596 GLOUCESTER [Aside] I hear yet say not much but think the more
44597 Enter a POST
44598 KING EDWARD Now messenger what letters or what news
44599 From France
44600 MESSENGER My sovereign liege no letters and few words
44601 But such as I without your special pardon
44602 Dare not relate
44603 KING EDWARD Go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
44604 Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
44605 What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters
44606 MESSENGER At my depart these were his very words
44607 'Go tell false Edward the supposed king
44608 That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
44609 To revel it with him and his new bride'
44610 KING EDWARD IS Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry
44611 But what said Lady Bona to my marriage
44612 MESSENGER These were her words utt'red with mild disdain
44613 'Tell him in hope he'll prove a widower shortly
44614 I'll wear the willowgarland for his sake'
44615 KING EDWARD I blame not her she could say little less
44616 She had the wrong But what said Henry's queen
44617 For I have heard that she was there in place
44618 MESSENGER 'Tell him quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done
44619 And I am ready to put armour on'
44620 KING EDWARD Belike she minds to play the Amazon
44621 But what said Warwick to these injuries
44622 MESSENGER He more incens'd against your Majesty
44623 Than all the rest discharg'd me with these words
44624 'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
44625 And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long'
44626 KING EDWARD Ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
44627 Well I will arm me being thus forewarn'd
44628 They shall have wars and pay for their presumption
44629 But say is Warwick friends with Margaret
44630 MESSENGER Ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship
44631 That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter
44632 CLARENCE Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger
44633 Now brother king farewell and sit you fast
44634 For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter
44635 That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage
44636 I may not prove inferior to yourself
44637 You that love me and Warwick follow me
44638 Exit and SOMERSET follows
44639 GLOUCESTER [Aside] Not I
44640 My thoughts aim at a further matter I
44641 Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown
44642 KING EDWARD Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick
44643 Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen
44644 And haste is needful in this desp'rate case
44645 Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf
44646 Go levy men and make prepare for war
44647 They are already or quickly will be landed
44648 Myself in person will straight follow you
44649 Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
44650 But ere I go Hastings and Montague
44651 Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest
44652 Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
44653 Tell me if you love Warwick more than me
44654 If it be so then both depart to him
44655 I rather wish you foes than hollow friends
44656 But if you mind to hold your true obedience
44657 Give me assurance with some friendly vow
44658 That I may never have you in suspect
44659 MONTAGUE So God help Montague as he proves true
44660 HASTINGS And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause
44661 KING EDWARD Now brother Richard will you stand by us
44662 GLOUCESTER Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
44663 KING EDWARD Why so then am I sure of victory
44664 Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
44665 Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'r Exeunt
44666 SCENE II
44667 A plain in Warwickshire
44668 Enter WARWICK and OXFORD with French soldiers
44669 WARWICK Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
44670 The common people by numbers swarm to us
44671 Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
44672 But see where Somerset and Clarence comes
44673 Speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
44674 CLARENCE Fear not that my lord
44675 WARWICK Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick
44676 And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice
44677 To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
44678 Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love
44679 Else might I think that Clarence Edward's brother
44680 Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
44681 But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine
44682 And now what rests but in night's coverture
44683 Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd
44684 His soldiers lurking in the towns about
44685 And but attended by a simple guard
44686 We may surprise and take him at our pleasure
44687 Our scouts have found the adventure very easy
44688 That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
44689 With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus tents
44690 And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds
44691 So we well cover'd with the night's black mantle
44692 At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
44693 And seize himself I say not 'slaughter him'
44694 For I intend but only to surprise him
44695 You that will follow me to this attempt
44696 Applaud the name of Henry with your leader
44697 [They all cry 'Henry']
44698 Why then let's on our way in silent sort
44699 For Warwick and his friends God and Saint George Exeunt

44703 FIRST WATCHMAN Come on my masters each man take his stand
44704 The King by this is set him down to sleep
44705 SECOND WATCHMAN What will he not to bed
44706 FIRST WATCHMAN Why no for he hath made a solemn vow
44707 Never to lie and take his natural rest
44708 Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd
44709 SECOND WATCHMAN Tomorrow then belike shall be the day
44710 If Warwick be so near as men report
44711 THIRD WATCHMAN But say I pray what nobleman is that
44712 That with the King here resteth in his tent
44713 FIRST WATCHMAN 'Tis the Lord Hastings the King's chiefest friend
44714 THIRD WATCHMAN O is it So But why commands the King
44715 That his chief followers lodge in towns about him
44716 While he himself keeps in the cold field
44717 SECOND WATCHMAN 'Tis the more honour because more dangerous
44718 THIRD WATCHMAN Ay but give me worship and quietness
44719 I like it better than dangerous honour
44720 If Warwick knew in what estate he stands
44721 'Tis to be doubted he would waken him
44722 FIRST WATCHMAN Unless our halberds did shut up his passage
44723 SECOND WATCHMAN Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
44724 But to defend his person from nightfoes
44725 Enter WARWICK CLARENCE OXFORD SOMERSET
44726 and French soldiers silent all
44727 WARWICK This is his tent and see where stand his guard
44728 Courage my masters Honour now or never

44737 sitting in a chair GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage
44738 SOMERSET What are they that fly there
44739 WARWICK Richard and Hastings Let them go here is the Duke
44740 KING EDWARD The Duke Why Warwick when we parted
44741 Thou call'dst me King
44742 WARWICK Ay but the case is alter'd
44743 When you disgrac'd me in my embassade
44744 Then I degraded you from being King
44745 And come now to create you Duke of York
44746 Alas how should you govern any kingdom
44747 That know not how to use ambassadors
44748 Nor how to be contented with one wife
44749 Nor how to use your brothers brotherly
44750 Nor how to study for the people's welfare
44751 Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
44752 KING EDWARD Yea brother of Clarence art thou here too
44753 Nay then I see that Edward needs must down
44754 Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance
44755 Of thee thyself and all thy complices
44756 Edward will always bear himself as King
44757 Though fortune's malice overthrow my state
44758 My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
44759 WARWICK Then for his mind be Edward England's king
44760 [Takes off his crown]
44761 But Henry now shall wear the English crown
44762 And be true King indeed thou but the shadow
44763 My Lord of Somerset at my request
44764 See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
44765 Unto my brother Archbishop of York
44766 When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
44767 I'll follow you and tell what answer
44768 Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him
44769 Now for a while farewell good Duke of York
44770 KING EDWARD What fates impose that men must needs abide
44771 It boots not to resist both wind and tide
44772 [They lead him out forcibly]
44773 OXFORD What now remains my lords for us to do
44774 But march to London with our soldiers
44775 WARWICK Ay that's the first thing that we have to do
44776 To free King Henry from imprisonment
44777 And see him seated in the regal throne Exeunt
44778 SCENE IV
44779 London The palace
44780 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS
44781 RIVERS Madam what makes you in this sudden change
44782 QUEEN ELIZABETH Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn
44783 What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward
44784 RIVERS What loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick
44785 QUEEN ELIZABETH No but the loss of his own royal person
44786 RIVERS Then is my sovereign slain
44787 QUEEN ELIZABETH Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
44788 Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
44789 Or by his foe surpris'd at unawares
44790 And as I further have to understand
44791 Is new committed to the Bishop of York
44792 Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe
44793 RIVERS These news I must confess are full of grief
44794 Yet gracious madam bear it as you may
44795 Warwick may lose that now hath won the day
44796 QUEEN ELIZABETH Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay
44797 And I the rather wean me from despair
44798 For love of Edward's offspring in my womb
44799 This is it that makes me bridle passion
44800 And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross
44801 Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear
44802 And stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
44803 Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
44804 King Edward's fruit true heir to th English crown
44805 RIVERS But madam where is Warwick then become
44806 QUEEN ELIZABETH I am inform'd that he comes towards London
44807 To set the crown once more on Henry's head
44808 Guess thou the rest King Edward's friends must down
44809 But to prevent the tyrant's violence
44810 For trust not him that hath once broken faith
44811 I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
44812 To save at least the heir of Edward's right
44813 There shall I rest secure from force and fraud
44814 Come therefore let us fly while we may fly

44819 GLOUCESTER Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley
44820 Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither
44821 Into this chiefest thicket of the park
44822 Thus stands the case you know our King my brother
44823 Is prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands
44824 He hath good usage and great liberty
44825 And often but attended with weak guard
44826 Comes hunting this way to disport himself
44827 I have advertis'd him by secret means
44828 That if about this hour he make this way
44829 Under the colour of his usual game
44830 He shall here find his friends with horse and men
44831 To set him free from his captivity
44832 Enter KING EDWARD and a HUNTSMAN with him
44833 HUNTSMAN This way my lord for this way lies the game
44834 KING EDWARD Nay this way man See where the huntsmen stand
44835 Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest
44836 Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deer
44837 GLOUCESTER Brother the time and case requireth haste

44839 KING EDWARD But whither shall we then
44840 HASTINGS To Lynn my lord and shipt from thence to Flanders
44841 GLOUCESTER Well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning
44842 KING EDWARD Stanley I will requite thy forwardness
44843 GLOUCESTER But wherefore stay we 'Tis no time to talk
44844 KING EDWARD Huntsman what say'st thou Wilt thou go along
44845 HUNTSMAN Better do so than tarry and be hang'd

44850 London The Tower
44851 Flourish Enter KING HENRY CLARENCE WARWICK SOMERSET young HENRY
44852 EARL OF RICHMOND OXFORD MONTAGUE LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER and attendants
44853 KING HENRY Master Lieutenant now that God and friends
44854 Have shaken Edward from the regal seat
44855 And turn'd my captive state to liberty
44856 My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
44857 At our enlargement what are thy due fees
44858 LIEUTENANT Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns
44859 But if an humble prayer may prevail
44860 I then crave pardon of your Majesty
44861 KING HENRY For what Lieutenant For well using me
44862 Nay be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness
44863 For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
44864 Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
44865 Conceive when after many moody thoughts
44866 At last by notes of household harmony
44867 They quite forget their loss of liberty
44868 But Warwick after God thou set'st me free
44869 And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee
44870 He was the author thou the instrument
44871 Therefore that I may conquer fortune's spite
44872 By living low where fortune cannot hurt me
44873 And that the people of this blessed land
44874 May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
44875 Warwick although my head still wear the crown
44876 I here resign my government to thee
44877 For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
44878 WARWICK Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous
44879 And now may seem as wise as virtuous
44880 By spying and avoiding fortune's malice
44881 For few men rightly temper with the stars
44882 Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace
44883 For choosing me when Clarence is in place
44884 CLARENCE No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway
44885 To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity
44886 Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown
44887 As likely to be blest in peace and war
44888 And therefore I yield thee my free consent
44889 WARWICK And I choose Clarence only for Protector
44890 KING HENRY Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
44891 Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
44892 That no dissension hinder government
44893 I make you both Protectors of this land
44894 While I myself will lead a private life
44895 And in devotion spend my latter days
44896 To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise
44897 WARWICK What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will
44898 CLARENCE That he consents if Warwick yield consent
44899 For on thy fortune I repose myself
44900 WARWICK Why then though loath yet must I be content
44901 We'll yoke together like a double shadow
44902 To Henry's body and supply his place
44903 I mean in bearing weight of government
44904 While he enjoys the honour and his ease
44905 And Clarence now then it is more than needful
44906 Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor
44907 And all his lands and goods confiscated
44908 CLARENCE What else And that succession be determin'd
44909 WARWICK Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part
44910 KING HENRY But with the first of all your chief affairs
44911 Let me entreat for I command no more
44912 That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward
44913 Be sent for to return from France with speed
44914 For till I see them here by doubtful fear
44915 My joy of liberty is half eclips'd
44916 CLARENCE It shall be done my sovereign with all speed
44917 KING HENRY My Lord of Somerset what youth is that
44918 Of whom you seem to have so tender care
44919 SOMERSET My liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond
44920 KING HENRY Come hither England's hope
44921 [Lays his hand on his head]
44922 If secret powers
44923 Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
44924 This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss
44925 His looks are full of peaceful majesty
44926 His head by nature fram'd to wear a crown
44927 His hand to wield a sceptre and himself
44928 Likely in time to bless a regal throne
44929 Make much of him my lords for this is he
44930 Must help you more than you are hurt by me
44931 Enter a POST
44932 WARWICK What news my friend
44933 POST That Edward is escaped from your brother
44934 And fled as he hears since to Burgundy
44935 WARWICK Unsavoury news But how made he escape
44936 POST He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
44937 And the Lord Hastings who attended him
44938 In secret ambush on the forest side
44939 And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him
44940 For hunting was his daily exercise
44941 WARWICK My brother was too careless of his charge
44942 But let us hence my sovereign to provide
44943 A salve for any sore that may betide
44944 Exeunt all but SOMERSET RICHMOND and OXFORD
44945 SOMERSET My lord I like not of this flight of Edward's
44946 For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
44947 And we shall have more wars befor't be long
44948 As Henry's late presaging prophecy
44949 Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
44950 So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
44951 What may befall him to his harm and ours
44952 Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst
44953 Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany
44954 Till storms be past of civil enmity
44955 OXFORD Ay for if Edward repossess the crown
44956 'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down
44957 SOMERSET It shall be so he shall to Brittany
44958 Come therefore let's about it speedily Exeunt

44965 My waned state for Henry's regal crown
44966 Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
44967 And brought desired help from Burgundy
44968 What then remains we being thus arriv'd
44969 From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York
44970 But that we enter as into our dukedom
44971 GLOUCESTER The gates made fast Brother I like not this
44972 For many men that stumble at the threshold
44973 Are well foretold that danger lurks within
44974 KING EDWARD Tush man abodements must not now affright us
44975 By fair or foul means we must enter in
44976 For hither will our friends repair to us
44977 HASTINGS My liege I'll knock once more to summon them
44978 Enter on the walls the MAYOR OF YORK and
44979 his BRETHREN
44980 MAYOR My lords we were forewarned of your coming
44981 And shut the gates for safety of ourselves
44982 For now we owe allegiance unto Henry
44983 KING EDWARD But Master Mayor if Henry be your King
44984 Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York
44985 MAYOR True my good lord I know you for no less
44986 KING EDWARD Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom
44987 As being well content with that alone
44988 GLOUCESTER [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose
44989 He'll soon find means to make the body follow
44990 HASTINGS Why Master Mayor why stand you in a doubt
44991 Open the gates we are King Henry's friends
44992 MAYOR Ay say you so The gates shall then be open'd
44993 [He descends]
44994 GLOUCESTER A wise stout captain and soon persuaded
44995 HASTINGS The good old man would fain that all were well
44996 So 'twere not long of him but being ent'red
44997 I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade
44998 Both him and all his brothers unto reason
44999 Enter below the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN
45000 KING EDWARD So Master Mayor These gates must not be shut
45001 But in the night or in the time of war
45002 What fear not man but yield me up the keys
45003 [Takes his keys]
45004 For Edward will defend the town and thee
45005 And all those friends that deign to follow me
45006 March Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers
45007 GLOUCESTER Brother this is Sir John Montgomery
45008 Our trusty friend unless I be deceiv'd
45009 KING EDWARD Welcome Sir john But why come you in arms
45010 MONTGOMERY To help King Edward in his time of storm
45011 As every loyal subject ought to do
45012 KING EDWARD Thanks good Montgomery but we now forget
45013 Our title to the crown and only claim
45014 Our dukedom till God please to send the rest
45015 MONTGOMERY Then fare you well for I will hence again

45019 KING EDWARD Nay stay Sir John a while and we'll debate
45020 By what safe means the crown may be recover'd
45021 MONTGOMERY What talk you of debating In few words
45022 If you'll not here proclaim yourself our King
45023 I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
45024 To keep them back that come to succour you
45025 Why shall we fight if you pretend no title
45026 GLOUCESTER Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
45027 KING EDWARD When we grow stronger then we'll make our claim
45028 Till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
45029 HASTINGS Away with scrupulous wit Now arms must rule
45030 GLOUCESTER And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
45031 Brother we will proclaim you out of hand
45032 The bruit thereof will bring you many friends
45033 KING EDWARD Then be it as you will for 'tis my right
45034 And Henry but usurps the diadem
45035 MONTGOMERY Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
45036 And now will I be Edward's champion
45037 HASTINGS Sound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaim'd
45038 Come fellow soldier make thou proclamation

45040 SOLDIER [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth by the grace of God
45041 King of England and France and Lord of Ireland &c'
45042 MONTGOMERY And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right

45049 And when the morning sun shall raise his car
45050 Above the border of this horizon
45051 We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates
45052 For well I wot that Henry is no soldier
45053 Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems the
45054 To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother
45055 Yet as we may we'll meet both thee and Warwick
45056 Come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day

45059 London The palace
45060 Flourish Enter KING HENRY WARWICK MONTAGUE CLARENCE OXFORD and EXETER
45061 WARWICK What counsel lords Edward from Belgia
45062 With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders
45063 Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas
45064 And with his troops doth march amain to London
45065 And many giddy people flock to him
45066 KING HENRY Let's levy men and beat him back again
45067 CLARENCE A little fire is quickly trodden out
45068 Which being suffer'd rivers cannot quench
45069 WARWICK In Warwickshire I have truehearted friends
45070 Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
45071 Those will I muster up and thou son Clarence
45072 Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent
45073 The knights and gentlemen to come with thee
45074 Thou brother Montague in Buckingham
45075 Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find
45076 Men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st
45077 And thou brave Oxford wondrous well belov'd
45078 In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
45079 My sovereign with the loving citizens
45080 Like to his island girt in with the ocean
45081 Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs
45082 Shall rest in London till we come to him
45083 Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
45084 Farewell my sovereign
45085 KING HENRY Farewell my Hector and my Troy's true hope
45086 CLARENCE In sign of truth I kiss your Highness hand
45087 KING HENRY Wellminded Clarence be thou fortunate
45088 MONTAGUE Comfort my lord and so I take my leave
45089 OXFORD [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid
45090 adieu

45092 And all at once once more a happy farewell
45093 WARWICK Farewell sweet lords let's meet at Coventry
45094 Exeunt all but the KING and EXETER
45095 KING HENRY Here at the palace will I rest a while
45096 Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship
45097 Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
45098 Should not be able to encounter mine
45099 EXETER The doubt is that he will seduce the rest
45100 KING HENRY That's not my fear my meed hath got me fame
45101 I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands
45102 Nor posted off their suits with slow delays
45103 My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
45104 My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs
45105 My mercy dried their waterflowing tears
45106 I have not been desirous of their wealth
45107 Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies
45108 Nor forward of revenge though they much err'd
45109 Then why should they love Edward more than me
45110 No Exeter these graces challenge grace
45111 And when the lion fawns upon the lamb
45112 The lamb will never cease to follow him
45113 [Shout within 'A Lancaster A Lancaster']

45116 KING EDWARD Seize on the shamefac'd Henry bear him hence
45117 And once again proclaim us King of England
45118 You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
45119 Now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry
45120 And swell so much the higher by their ebb
45121 Hence with him to the Tower let him not speak
45122 Exeunt some with KING HENRY
45123 And lords towards Coventry bend we our course
45124 Where peremptory Warwick now remains
45125 The sun shines hot and if we use delay
45126 Cold biting winter mars our hop'dfor hay
45127 GLOUCESTER Away betimes before his forces join
45128 And take the greatgrown traitor unawares
45129 Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry Exeunt

45153 [Drum heard]
45154 WARWICK Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum
45155 SOMERVILLE It is not his my lord here Southam lies

45161 KING EDWARD Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
45162 GLOUCESTER See how the surly Warwick mans the wall
45163 WARWICK O unbid spite Is sportful Edward come
45164 Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd
45165 That we could hear no news of his repair
45166 KING EDWARD Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
45167 Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
45168 Call Edward King and at his hands beg mercy
45169 And he shall pardon thee these outrages
45170 WARWICK Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
45171 Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down
45172 Call Warwick patron and be penitent
45173 And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York
45174 GLOUCESTER I thought at least he would have said the King
45175 Or did he make the jest against his will
45176 WARWICK Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
45177 GLOUCESTER Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
45178 I'll do thee service for so good a gift
45179 WARWICK 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother
45180 KING EDWARD Why then 'tis mine if but by Warwick's gift
45181 WARWICK Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
45182 And weakling Warwick takes his gift again
45183 And Henry is my King Warwick his subject
45184 KING EDWARD But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner
45185 And gallant Warwick do but answer this
45186 What is the body when the head is off
45187 GLOUCESTER Alas that Warwick had no more forecast
45188 But whiles he thought to steal the single ten
45189 The king was slily finger'd from the deck
45190 You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace
45191 And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower
45192 KING EDWARD 'Tis even so yet you are Warwick still
45193 GLOUCESTER Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
45194 Nay when Strike now or else the iron cools
45195 WARWICK I had rather chop this hand off at a blow
45196 And with the other fling it at thy face
45197 Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
45198 KING EDWARD Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
45199 This hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair
45200 Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
45201 Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood

45207 GLOUCESTER The gates are open let us enter too
45208 KING EDWARD So other foes may set upon our backs
45209 Stand we in good array for they no doubt
45210 Will issue out again and bid us battle
45211 If not the city being but of small defence
45212 We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same

45226 And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold
45227 Enter CLARENCE with drum and colours
45228 WARWICK And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along
45229 Of force enough to bid his brother battle
45230 With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
45231 More than the nature of a brother's love
45232 CLARENCE Clarence Clarence for Lancaster
45233 KING EDWARD Et tu Brute wilt thou stab Caesar too
45234 A parley sirrah to George of Clarence
45235 [Sound a parley RICHARD and CLARENCE whisper]
45236 WARWICK Come Clarence come Thou wilt if Warwick call
45237 CLARENCE [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing
45238 it at WARWICK]
45239 Father of Warwick know you what this means
45240 Look here I throw my infamy at thee
45241 I will not ruinate my father's house
45242 Who gave his blood to lime the stones together
45243 And set up Lancaster Why trowest thou Warwick
45244 That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
45245 To bend the fatal instruments of war
45246 Against his brother and his lawful King
45247 Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
45248 To keep that oath were more impiety
45249 Than Jephtha when he sacrific'd his daughter
45250 I am so sorry for my trespass made
45251 That to deserve well at my brother's hands
45252 I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
45253 With resolution whereso'er I meet thee
45254 As I will meet thee if thou stir abroad
45255 To plague thee for thy foul misleading me
45256 And so proudhearted Warwick I defy thee
45257 And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
45258 Pardon me Edward I will make amends
45259 And Richard do not frown upon my faults
45260 For I will henceforth be no more unconstant
45261 KING EDWARD Now welcome more and ten times more belov'd
45262 Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate
45263 GLOUCESTER Welcome good Clarence this is brotherlike
45264 WARWICK O passing traitor perjur'd and unjust
45265 KING EDWARD What Warwick wilt thou leave die town and fight
45266 Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
45267 WARWICK Alas I am not coop'd here for defence
45268 I will away towards Barnet presently

45275 A field of battle near Barnet
45276 Alarum and excursions Enter KING EDWARD bringing forth WARWICK wounded
45277 KING EDWARD So lie thou there Die thou and die our fear
45278 For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all
45279 Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee
45280 That Warwick's bones may keep thine company Exit
45281 WARWICK Ah who is nigh Come to me friend or foe
45282 And tell me who is victor York or Warwick
45283 Why ask I that My mangled body shows
45284 My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
45285 That I must yield my body to the earth
45286 And by my fall the conquest to my foe
45287 Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
45288 Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
45289 Under whose shade the ramping lion slept
45290 Whose topbranch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
45291 And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind
45292 These eyes that now are dimm'd with death's black veil
45293 Have been as piercing as the midday sun
45294 To search the secret treasons of the world
45295 The wrinkles in my brows now fill'd with blood
45296 Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres
45297 For who liv'd King but I could dig his grave
45298 And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow
45299 Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood
45300 My parks my walks my manors that I had
45301 Even now forsake me and of all my lands
45302 Is nothing left me but my body's length
45303 what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
45304 And live we how we can yet die we must
45305 Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
45306 SOMERSET Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are
45307 We might recover all our loss again
45308 The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power
45309 Even now we heard the news Ah couldst thou fly
45310 WARWICK Why then I would not fly Ah Montague
45311 If thou be there sweet brother take my hand
45312 And with thy lips keep in my soul a while
45313 Thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst
45314 Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
45315 That glues my lips and will not let me speak
45316 Come quickly Montague or I am dead
45317 SOMERSET Ah Warwick Montague hath breath'd his last
45318 And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
45319 And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother'
45320 And more he would have said and more he spoke
45321 Which sounded like a clamour in a vault
45322 That mought not be distinguish'd but at last
45323 I well might hear delivered with a groan
45324 'O farewell Warwick'
45325 WARWICK Sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves
45326 For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
45327 [Dies]
45328 OXFORD Away away to meet the Queen's great power

45333 KING EDWARD Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
45334 And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory
45335 But in the midst of this brightshining day
45336 I spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud
45337 That will encounter with our glorious sun
45338 Ere he attain his easeful western bed
45339 I mean my lords those powers that the Queen
45340 Hath rais'd in Gallia have arriv'd our coast
45341 And as we hear march on to fight with us
45342 CLARENCE A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
45343 And blow it to the source from whence it came
45344 Thy very beams will dry those vapours up
45345 For every cloud engenders not a storm
45346 GLOUCESTER The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong
45347 And Somerset with Oxford fled to her
45348 If she have time to breathe be well assur'd
45349 Her faction will be full as strong as ours
45350 KING EDWARD are advertis'd by our loving friends
45351 That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury
45352 We having now the best at Barnet field
45353 Will thither straight for willingness rids way

45360 and SOLDIERS
45361 QUEEN MARGARET Great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their
45362 loss
45363 But cheerly seek how to redress their harms
45364 What though the mast be now blown overboard
45365 The cable broke the holdinganchor lost
45366 And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood
45367 Yet lives our pilot still Is't meet that he
45368 Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
45369 With tearful eyes add water to the sea
45370 And give more strength to that which hath too much
45371 Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
45372 Which industry and courage might have sav'd
45373 Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
45374 Say Warwick was our anchor what of that
45375 And Montague our topmast what of him
45376 Our slaught'red friends the tackles what of these
45377 Why is not Oxford here another anchor
45378 And Somerset another goodly mast
45379 The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings
45380 And though unskilful why not Ned and I
45381 For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge
45382 We will not from the helm to sit and weep
45383 But keep our course though the rough wind say no
45384 From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck
45385 As good to chide the waves as speak them fair
45386 And what is Edward but a ruthless sea
45387 What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit
45388 And Richard but a ragged fatal rock
45389 All these the enemies to our poor bark
45390 Say you can swim alas 'tis but a while
45391 Tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
45392 Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
45393 Or else you famish that's a threefold death
45394 This speak I lords to let you understand
45395 If case some one of you would fly from us
45396 That there's no hop'dfor mercy with the brothers
45397 More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
45398 Why courage then What cannot be avoided
45399 'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear
45400 PRINCE OF WALES Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
45401 Should if a coward hear her speak these words
45402 Infuse his breast with magnanimity
45403 And make him naked foil a manatarms
45404 I speak not this as doubting any here
45405 For did I but suspect a fearful man
45406 He should have leave to go away betimes
45407 Lest in our need he might infect another
45408 And make him of the like spirit to himself
45409 If any such be here as God forbid
45410 Let him depart before we need his help
45411 OXFORD Women and children of so high a courage
45412 And warriors faint Why 'twere perpetual shame
45413 O brave young Prince thy famous grandfather
45414 Doth live again in thee Long mayst thou Eve
45415 To bear his image and renew his glories
45416 SOMERSET And he that will not fight for such a hope
45417 Go home to bed and like the owl by day
45418 If he arise be mock'd and wond'red at

45421 Enter a MESSENGER
45422 MESSENGER Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand

45436 Give signal to the fight and to it lords
45437 QUEEN MARGARET Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say
45438 My tears gainsay for every word I speak
45439 Ye see I drink the water of my eye
45440 Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign
45441 Is prisoner to the foe his state usurp'd
45442 His realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain
45443 His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent

45470 PRINCE OF WALES Speak like a subject proud ambitious York
45471 Suppose that I am now my father's mouth
45472 Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou

45495 CLARENCE And there's for twitting me with perjury

45507 QUEEN MARGARET O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy
45508 Canst thou not speak O traitors murderers
45509 They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all
45510 Did not offend nor were not worthy blame
45511 If this foul deed were by to equal it
45512 He was a man this in respect a child
45513 And men ne'er spend their fury on a child
45514 What's worse than murderer that I may name it
45515 No no my heart will burst an if I speak
45516 And I will speak that so my heart may burst
45517 Butchers and villains bloody cannibals
45518 How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd
45519 You have no children butchers if you had
45520 The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse
45521 But if you ever chance to have a child
45522 Look in his youth to have him so cut off
45523 As deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince
45524 KING EDWARD Away with her go bear her hence perforce
45525 QUEEN MARGARET Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
45526 Here sheathe thy sword I'll pardon thee my death

45529 QUEEN MARGARET Good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it
45530 CLARENCE Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it
45531 QUEEN MARGARET Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself
45532 'Twas sin before but now 'tis charity
45533 What wilt thou not Where is that devil's butcher
45534 Hardfavour'd Richard Richard where art thou
45535 Thou art not here Murder is thy almsdeed
45536 Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back
45537 KING EDWARD Away I say I charge ye bear her hence
45538 QUEEN MARGARET So come to you and yours as to this prince
45539 Exit led out forcibly
45540 KING EDWARD Where's Richard gone
45541 CLARENCE To London all in post and as I guess
45542 To make a bloody supper in the Tower
45543 KING EDWARD He's sudden if a thing comes in his head
45544 Now march we hence Discharge the common sort
45545 With pay and thanks and let's away to London
45546 And see our gentle queen how well she fares
45547 By this I hope she hath a son for me Exeunt
45548 SCENE VI
45549 London The Tower
45550 Enter KING HENRY and GLOUCESTER with the LIEUTENANT on the walls
45551 GLOUCESTER Good day my lord What at your book so hard
45552 KING HENRY Ay my good lord my lord I should say rather
45553 'Tis sin to flatter 'good was little better
45554 'Good Gloucester and 'good devil were alike
45555 And both preposterous therefore not 'good lord'
45556 GLOUCESTER Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer
45557 Exit LIEUTENANT
45558 KING HENRY So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
45559 So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
45560 And next his throat unto the butcher's knife
45561 What scene of death hath Roscius now to act
45562 GLOUCESTER Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
45563 The thief doth fear each bush an officer
45564 KING HENRY The bird that hath been limed in a bush
45565 With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
45566 And I the hapless male to one sweet bird
45567 Have now the fatal object in my eye
45568 Where my poor young was lim'd was caught and kill'd
45569 GLOUCESTER Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete
45570 That taught his son the office of a fowl
45571 And yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd
45572 KING HENRY I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus
45573 Thy father Minos that denied our course
45574 The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
45575 Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea
45576 Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
45577 Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
45578 My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
45579 Than can my ears that tragic history
45580 But wherefore dost thou come Is't for my life
45581 GLOUCESTER Think'st thou I am an executioner
45582 KING HENRY A persecutor I am sure thou art
45583 If murdering innocents be executing
45584 Why then thou are an executioner
45585 GLOUCESTER Thy son I kill'd for his presumption
45586 KING HENRY Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume
45587 Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine
45588 And thus I prophesy that many a thousand
45589 Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
45590 And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's
45591 And many an orphan's waterstanding eye
45592 Men for their sons wives for their husbands
45593 Orphans for their parents timeless death
45594 Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
45595 The owl shriek'd at thy birth an evil sign
45596 The nightcrow cried aboding luckless time
45597 Dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees
45598 The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top
45599 And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung
45600 Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain
45601 And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope
45602 To wit an indigest deformed lump
45603 Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
45604 Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
45605 To signify thou cam'st to bite the world
45606 And if the rest be true which I have heard
45607 Thou cam'st
45608 GLOUCESTER I'll hear no more Die prophet in thy speech
45609 [Stabs him]
45610 For this amongst the rest was I ordain'd
45611 KING HENRY Ay and for much more slaughter after this
45612 O God forgive my sins and pardon thee [Dies]
45613 GLOUCESTER What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
45614 Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted
45615 See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death
45616 O may such purple tears be always shed
45617 From those that wish the downfall of our house
45618 If any spark of life be yet remaining
45619 Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither
45620 [Stabs him again]
45621 I that have neither pity love nor fear
45622 Indeed 'tis true that Henry told me of
45623 For I have often heard my mother say
45624 I came into the world with my legs forward
45625 Had I not reason think ye to make haste
45626 And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right
45627 The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
45628 'O Jesus bless us he is born with teeth'
45629 And so I was which plainly signified
45630 That I should snarl and bite and play the dog
45631 Then since the heavens have shap'd my body so
45632 Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it
45633 I have no brother I am like no brother
45634 And this word 'love which greybeards call divine
45635 Be resident in men like one another
45636 And not in me I am myself alone
45637 Clarence beware thou keep'st me from the light
45638 But I will sort a pitchy day for thee
45639 For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
45640 That Edward shall be fearful of his life
45641 And then to purge his fear I'll be thy death
45642 King Henry and the Prince his son are gone
45643 Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
45644 Counting myself but bad till I be best
45645 I'll throw thy body in another room
45646 And triumph Henry in thy day of doom
45647 Exit with the body
45648 SCENE VII
45649 London The palace
45650 Flourish Enter KING EDWARD QUEEN ELIZABETH CLARENCE GLOUCESTER
45651 HASTINGS NURSE with the Young PRINCE and attendants
45652 KING EDWARD Once more we sit in England's royal throne
45653 Repurchas'd with the blood of enemies
45654 What valiant foemen like to autumn's corn
45655 Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride
45656 Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renown'd
45657 For hardy and undoubted champions
45658 Two Cliffords as the father and the son
45659 And two Northumberlands two braver men
45660 Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound
45661 With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague
45662 That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
45663 And made the forest tremble when they roar'd
45664 Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
45665 And made our footstool of security
45666 Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy
45667 Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself
45668 Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night
45669 Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat
45670 That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace
45671 And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain
45672 GLOUCESTER [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid
45673 For yet I am not look'd on in the world
45674 This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave
45675 And heave it shall some weight or break my back
45676 Work thou the way and that shall execute
45677 KING EDWARD Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen
45678 And kiss your princely nephew brothers both
45679 CLARENCE The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
45680 I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe
45681 KING EDWARD Thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks
45682 GLOUCESTER And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st
45683 Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit
45684 [Aside] To say the truth so Judas kiss'd his master
45685 And cried 'All hail when as he meant all harm
45686 KING EDWARD Now am I seated as my soul delights
45687 Having my country's peace and brothers loves
45688 CLARENCE What will your Grace have done with Margaret
45689 Reignier her father to the King of France
45690 Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem
45691 And hither have they sent it for her ransom
45692 KING EDWARD Away with her and waft her hence to France
45693 And now what rests but that we spend the time
45694 With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
45695 Such as befits the pleasure of the court
45696 Sound drums and trumpets Farewell sour annoy
45697 For here I hope begins our lasting joy Exeunt

45743 THE PROLOGUE
45744 I come no more to make you laugh things now
45745 That bear a weighty and a serious brow
45746 Sad high and working full of state and woe
45747 Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
45748 We now present Those that can pity here
45749 May if they think it well let fall a tear
45750 The subject will deserve it Such as give
45751 Their money out of hope they may believe
45752 May here find truth too Those that come to see
45753 Only a show or two and so agree
45754 The play may pass if they be still and willing
45755 I'll undertake may see away their shilling
45756 Richly in two short hours Only they
45757 That come to hear a merry bawdy play
45758 A noise of targets or to see a fellow
45759 In a long motley coat guarded with yellow
45760 Will be deceiv'd for gentle hearers know
45761 To rank our chosen truth with such a show
45762 As fool and fight is beside forfeiting
45763 Our own brains and the opinion that we bring
45764 To make that only true we now intend
45765 Will leave us never an understanding friend
45766 Therefore for goodness sake and as you are known

45769 The very persons of our noble story
45770 As they were living think you see them great
45771 And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
45772 Of thousand friends then in a moment see
45773 How soon this mightiness meets misery
45774 And if you can be merry then I'll say
45775 A man may weep upon his weddingday

45784 ACT I SCENE 1
45785 London The palace
45786 Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door at the other
45787 the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY
45788 BUCKINGHAM Good morrow and well met How have ye done
45789 Since last we saw in France
45790 NORFOLK I thank your Grace
45791 Healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
45792 Of what I saw there
45793 BUCKINGHAM An untimely ague
45794 Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
45795 Those suns of glory those two lights of men
45796 Met in the vale of Andren
45797 NORFOLK 'Twixt Guynes and Arde
45798 I was then present saw them salute on horseback
45799 Beheld them when they lighted how they clung
45800 In their embracement as they grew together
45801 Which had they what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd
45802 Such a compounded one
45803 BUCKINGHAM All the whole time
45804 I was my chamber's prisoner
45805 NORFOLK Then you lost
45806 The view of earthly glory men might say
45807 Till this time pomp was single but now married
45808 To one above itself Each following day
45809 Became the next day's master till the last
45810 Made former wonders its Today the French
45811 All clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
45812 Shone down the English and tomorrow they
45813 Made Britain India every man that stood
45814 Show'd like a mine Their dwarfish pages were
45815 As cherubins an gilt the madams too
45816 Not us'd to toil did almost sweat to bear
45817 The pride upon them that their very labour
45818 Was to them as a painting Now this masque
45819 Was cried incomparable and th ensuing night
45820 Made it a fool and beggar The two kings
45821 Equal in lustre were now best now worst
45822 As presence did present them him in eye
45823 still him in praise and being present both
45824 'Twas said they saw but one and no discerner
45825 Durst wag his tongue in censure When these suns
45826 For so they phrase 'emby their heralds challeng'd
45827 The noble spirits to arms they did perform
45828 Beyond thought's compass that former fabulous story
45829 Being now seen possible enough got credit
45830 That Bevis was believ'd
45831 BUCKINGHAM O you go far
45832 NORFOLK As I belong to worship and affect
45833 In honour honesty the tract of ev'rything
45834 Would by a good discourser lose some life
45835 Which action's self was tongue to All was royal
45836 To the disposing of it nought rebell'd
45837 Order gave each thing view The office did
45838 Distinctly his full function
45839 BUCKINGHAM Who did guide
45840 I mean who set the body and the limbs
45841 Of this great sport together as you guess
45842 NORFOLK One certes that promises no element
45843 In such a business
45844 BUCKINGHAM I pray you who my lord
45845 NORFOLK All this was ord'red by the good discretion
45846 Of the right reverend Cardinal of York
45847 BUCKINGHAM The devil speed him No man's pie is freed
45848 From his ambitious finger What had he
45849 To do in these fierce vanities I wonder
45850 That such a keech can with his very bulk
45851 Take up the rays o th beneficial sun
45852 And keep it from the earth
45853 NORFOLK Surely sir
45854 There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends
45855 For being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace
45856 Chalks successors their way nor call'd upon
45857 For high feats done to th crown neither allied
45858 To eminent assistants but spiderlike
45859 Out of his selfdrawing web 'a gives us note
45860 The force of his own merit makes his way
45861 A gift that heaven gives for him which buys
45862 A place next to the King
45863 ABERGAVENNY I cannot tell
45864 What heaven hath given himlet some graver eye
45865 Pierce into that but I can see his pride
45866 Peep through each part of him Whence has he that
45867 If not from hell the devil is a niggard
45868 Or has given all before and he begins
45869 A new hell in himself
45870 BUCKINGHAM Why the devil
45871 Upon this French going out took he upon him
45872 Without the privity o th Kingt appoint
45873 Who should attend on him He makes up the file
45874 Of all the gentry for the most part such
45875 To whom as great a charge as little honour
45876 He meant to lay upon and his own letter
45877 The honourable board of council out
45878 Must fetch him in he papers
45879 ABERGAVENNY I do know
45880 Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
45881 By this so sicken'd their estates that never
45882 They shall abound as formerly
45883 BUCKINGHAM O many
45884 Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
45885 For this great journey What did this vanity
45886 But minister communication of
45887 A most poor issue
45888 NORFOLK Grievingly I think
45889 The peace between the French and us not values
45890 The cost that did conclude it
45891 BUCKINGHAM Every man
45892 After the hideous storm that follow'd was
45893 A thing inspir'd and not consulting broke
45894 Into a general prophecythat this tempest
45895 Dashing the garment of this peace aboded
45896 The sudden breach on't
45897 NORFOLK Which is budded out
45898 For France hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd
45899 Our merchants goods at Bordeaux
45900 ABERGAVENNY Is it therefore
45901 Th ambassador is silenc'd
45902 NORFOLK Marry is't
45903 ABERGAVENNY A proper tide of a peace and purchas'd
45904 At a superfluous rate
45905 BUCKINGHAM Why all this business
45906 Our reverend Cardinal carried
45907 NORFOLK Like it your Grace
45908 The state takes notice of the private difference
45909 Betwixt you and the Cardinal I advise you
45910 And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
45911 Honour and plenteous safetythat you read
45912 The Cardinal's malice and his potency
45913 Together to consider further that
45914 What his high hatred would effect wants not
45915 A minister in his power You know his nature
45916 That he's revengeful and I know his sword
45917 Hath a sharp edgeit's long and't may be said
45918 It reaches far and where 'twill not extend
45919 Thither he darts it Bosom up my counsel
45920 You'll find it wholesome Lo where comes that rock
45921 That I advise your shunning
45922 Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY the purse borne before
45923 him certain of the guard and two SECRETARIES
45924 with papers The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his
45925 eye on BUCKINGHAM and BUCKINGHAM on him
45926 both full of disdain
45927 WOLSEY The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor Ha
45928 Where's his examination
45929 SECRETARY Here so please you
45930 WOLSEY Is he in person ready
45931 SECRETARY Ay please your Grace
45932 WOLSEY Well we shall then know more and Buckingham
45933 shall lessen this big look
45934 Exeunt WOLSEY and his train
45935 BUCKINGHAM This butcher's cur is venommouth'd and I
45936 Have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
45937 Not wake him in his slumber A beggar's book
45938 Outworths a noble's blood
45939 NORFOLK What are you chaf'd
45940 Ask God for temp'rance that's th appliance only
45941 Which your disease requires
45942 BUCKINGHAM I read in's looks
45943 Matter against me and his eye revil'd
45944 Me as his abject object At this instant
45945 He bores me with some trick He's gone to th King
45946 I'll follow and outstare him
45947 NORFOLK Stay my lord
45948 And let your reason with your choler question
45949 What 'tis you go about To climb steep hills
45950 Requires slow pace at first Anger is like
45951 A full hot horse who being allow'd his way
45952 Selfmettle tires him Not a man in England
45953 Can advise me like you be to yourself
45954 As you would to your friend
45955 BUCKINGHAM I'll to the King
45956 And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
45957 This Ipswich fellow's insolence or proclaim
45958 There's difference in no persons
45959 NORFOLK Be advis'd
45960 Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
45961 That it do singe yourself We may outrun
45962 By violent swiftness that which we run at
45963 And lose by overrunning Know you not
45964 The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er
45965 In seeming to augment it wastes it Be advis'd
45966 I say again there is no English soul
45967 More stronger to direct you than yourself
45968 If with the sap of reason you would quench
45969 Or but allay the fire of passion
45970 BUCKINGHAM Sir
45971 I am thankful to you and I'll go along
45972 By your prescription but this topproud fellow
45973 Whom from the flow of gan I name not but
45974 From sincere motions by intelligence
45975 And proofs as clear as founts in July when
45976 We see each grain of gravelI do know
45977 To be corrupt and treasonous
45978 NORFOLK Say not treasonous
45979 BUCKINGHAM To th King I'll say't and make my vouch as strong
45980 As shore of rock Attend this holy fox
45981 Or wolf or bothfor he is equal rav'nous
45982 As he is subtle and as prone to mischief
45983 As able to perform't his mind and place
45984 Infecting one another yea reciprocally
45985 Only to show his pomp as well in France
45986 As here at home suggests the King our master
45987 To this last costly treaty th interview
45988 That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass
45989 Did break i th wrenching
45990 NORFOLK Faith and so it did
45991 BUCKINGHAM Pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
45992 The articles o th combination drew
45993 As himself pleas'd and they were ratified
45994 As he cried 'Thus let be to as much end
45995 As give a crutch to th dead But our CountCardinal
45996 Has done this and 'tis well for worthy Wolsey
45997 Who cannot err he did it Now this follows
45998 Which as I take it is a kind of puppy
45999 To th old dam treason Charles the Emperor
46000 Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt
46001 For 'twas indeed his colour but he came
46002 To whisper Wolseyhere makes visitation

46004 England and France might through their amity
46005 Breed him some prejudice for from this league
46006 Peep'd harms that menac'd himprivily
46007 Deals with our Cardinal and as I trow
46008 Which I do well for I am sure the Emperor
46009 Paid ere he promis'd whereby his suit was granted
46010 Ere it was ask'dbut when the way was made
46011 And pav'd with gold the Emperor thus desir'd
46012 That he would please to alter the King's course
46013 And break the foresaid peace Let the King know

46096 Are in great grievance there have been commissions
46097 Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart
46098 Of all their loyalties wherein although
46099 My good Lord Cardinal they vent reproaches
46100 Most bitterly on you as putteron
46101 Of these exactions yet the King our master
46102 Whose honour Heaven shield from soileven he escapes not
46103 Language unmannerly yea such which breaks
46104 The sides of loyalty and almost appears
46105 In loud rebellion
46106 NORFOLK Not almost appears
46107 It doth appear for upon these taxations
46108 The clothiers all not able to maintain
46109 The many to them 'longing have put of

46117 You that are blam'd for it alike with us
46118 Know you of this taxation
46119 WOLSEY Please you sir
46120 I know but of a single part in aught
46121 Pertains to th state and front but in that file
46122 Where others tell steps with me
46123 QUEEN KATHARINE No my lord
46124 You know no more than others But you frame
46125 Things that are known alike which are not wholesome
46126 To those which would not know them and yet must
46127 Perforce be their acquaintance These exactions
46128 Whereof my sovereign would have note they are
46129 Most pestilent to th hearing and to bear 'em

46131 They are devis'd by you or else you suffer
46132 Too hard an exclamation
46133 KING Still exaction
46134 The nature of it In what kind let's know
46135 Is this exaction
46136 QUEEN KATHARINE I am much too venturous

46138 Under your promis'd pardon The subjects grief
46139 Comes through commissions which compels from each
46140 The sixth part of his substance to be levied
46141 Without delay and the pretence for this
46142 Is nam'd your wars in France This makes bold mouths
46143 Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
46144 Allegiance in them their curses now
46145 Live where their prayers did and it's come to pass
46146 This tractable obedience is a slave
46147 To each incensed will I would your Highness
46148 Would give it quick consideration for
46149 There is no primer business
46150 KING By my life
46151 This is against our pleasure
46152 WOLSEY And for me
46153 I have no further gone in this than by
46154 A single voice and that not pass'd me but
46155 By learned approbation of the judges If I am
46156 Traduc'd by ignorant tongues which neither know
46157 My faculties nor person yet will be
46158 The chronicles of my doing let me say
46159 'Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake
46160 That virtue must go through We must not stint
46161 Our necessary actions in the fear
46162 To cope malicious censurers which ever
46163 As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow
46164 That is newtrimm'd but benefit no further
46165 Than vainly longing What we oft do best
46166 By sick interpreters once weak ones is
46167 Not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft
46168 Hitting a grosser quality is cried up
46169 For our best act If we shall stand still

46171 We should take root here where we sit or sit
46172 Statestatues only
46173 KING Things done well

46177 Of this commission I believe not any
46178 We must not rend our subjects from our laws
46179 And stick them in our will Sixth part of each
46180 A trembling contribution Why we take
46181 From every tree lop bark and part o th timber
46182 And though we leave it with a root thus hack'd
46183 The air will drink the sap To every county
46184 Where this is question'd send our letters with
46185 Free pardon to each man that has denied
46186 The force of this commission Pray look tot
46187 I put it to your care

46198 KING It grieves many
46199 The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker
46200 To nature none more bound his training such
46201 That he may furnish and instruct great teachers
46202 And never seek for aid out of himself Yet see
46203 When these so noble benefits shall prove
46204 Not well dispos'd the mind growing once corrupt
46205 They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
46206 Than ever they were fair This man so complete
46207 Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders and when we
46208 Almost with ravish'd list'ning could not find
46209 His hour of speech a minutehe my lady
46210 Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
46211 That once were his and is become as black
46212 As if besmear'd in hell Sit by us you shall hear
46213 This was his gentleman in trustof him
46214 Things to strike honour sad Bid him recount
46215 The forerecited practices whereof
46216 We cannot feel too little hear too much
46217 WOLSEY Stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
46218 Most like a careful subject have collected
46219 Out of the Duke of Buckingham
46220 KING Speak freely
46221 SURVEYOR First it was usual with himevery day
46222 It would infect his speechthat if the King
46223 Should without issue die he'll carry it so
46224 To make the sceptre his These very words
46225 I've heard him utter to his soninlaw
46226 Lord Aberga'ny to whom by oath he menac'd
46227 Revenge upon the Cardinal
46228 WOLSEY Please your Highness note
46229 This dangerous conception in this point
46230 Not friended by his wish to your high person
46231 His will is most malignant and it stretches
46232 Beyond you to your friends
46233 QUEEN KATHARINE My learn'd Lord Cardinal
46234 Deliver all with charity
46235 KING Speak on
46236 How grounded he his title to the crown
46237 Upon our fail To this point hast thou heard him
46238 At any time speak aught
46239 SURVEYOR He was brought to this
46240 By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton
46241 KING What was that Henton
46242 SURVEYOR Sir a Chartreux friar
46243 His confessor who fed him every minute
46244 With words of sovereignty
46245 KING How know'st thou this
46246 SURVEYOR Not long before your Highness sped to France
46247 The Duke being at the Rose within the parish
46248 Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand
46249 What was the speech among the Londoners
46250 Concerning the French journey I replied
46251 Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious
46252 To the King's danger Presently the Duke
46253 Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted
46254 'Twould prove the verity of certain words
46255 Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft says he
46256 'Hath sent to me wishing me to permit
46257 John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour
46258 To hear from him a matter of some moment
46259 Whom after under the confession's seal
46260 He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
46261 My chaplain to no creature living but
46262 To me should utter with demure confidence
46263 This pausingly ensu'd Neither the King nor's heirs
46264 Tell you the Duke shall prosper bid him strive
46265 To gain the love o th commonalty the Duke
46266 Shall govern England'

46268 You were the Duke's surveyor and lost your office
46269 On the complaint o th tenants Take good heed
46270 You charge not in your spleen a noble person
46271 And spoil your nobler soul I say take heed
46272 Yes heartily beseech you
46273 KING Let him on
46274 Go forward
46275 SURVEYOR On my soul I'll speak but truth
46276 I told my lord the Duke by th devil's illusions
46277 The monk might be deceiv'd and that 'twas dangerous
46278 for him
46279 To ruminate on this so far until
46280 It forg'd him some design which being believ'd
46281 It was much like to do He answer'd 'Tush
46282 It can do me no damage adding further
46283 That had the King in his last sickness fail'd
46284 The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
46285 Should have gone off
46286 KING Ha what so rank Ah ha

46299 Th usurper Richard who being at Salisbury
46300 Made suit to come in's presence which if granted
46301 As he made semblance of his duty would
46302 Have put his knife into him'

46309 He stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger
46310 Another spread on's breast mounting his eyes
46311 He did discharge a horrible oath whose tenour
46312 Was were he evil us'd he would outgo
46313 His father by as much as a performance
46314 Does an irresolute purpose
46315 KING There's his period
46316 To sheath his knife in us He is attach'd
46317 Call him to present trial If he may

46576 ACT II SCENE 1
46577 Westminster A street
46578 Enter two GENTLEMEN at several doors
46579 FIRST GENTLEMAN Whither away so fast
46580 SECOND GENTLEMAN O God save ye
46581 Ev'n to the Hall to hear what shall become
46582 Of the great Duke of Buckingham
46583 FIRST GENTLEMAN I'll save you
46584 That labour sir All's now done but the ceremony
46585 Of bringing back the prisoner
46586 SECOND GENTLEMAN Were you there
46587 FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes indeed was I
46588 SECOND GENTLEMAN Pray speak what has happen'd
46589 FIRST GENTLEMAN You may guess quickly what
46590 SECOND GENTLEMAN Is he found guilty
46591 FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't
46592 SECOND GENTLEMAN I am sorry for't
46593 FIRST GENTLEMAN So are a number more
46594 SECOND GENTLEMAN But pray how pass'd it
46595 FIRST GENTLEMAN I'll tell you in a little The great Duke
46596 Came to the bar where to his accusations
46597 He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
46598 Many sharp reasons to defeat the law
46599 The King's attorney on the contrary
46600 Urg'd on the examinations proofs confessions
46601 Of divers witnesses which the Duke desir'd
46602 To have brought viva voce to his face
46603 At which appear'd against him his surveyor
46604 Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car
46605 Confessor to him with that devilmonk
46606 Hopkins that made this mischief
46607 SECOND GENTLEMAN That was he
46608 That fed him with his prophecies
46609 FIRST GENTLEMAN The same
46610 All these accus'd him strongly which he fain
46611 Would have flung from him but indeed he could not
46612 And so his peers upon this evidence
46613 Have found him guilty of high treason Much
46614 He spoke and learnedly for life but all
46615 Was either pitied in him or forgotten
46616 SECOND GENTLEMAN After all this how did he bear himself
46617 FIRST GENTLEMAN When he was brought again to th bar to hear
46618 His knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd
46619 With such an agony he sweat extremely
46620 And something spoke in choler ill and hasty
46621 But he fell to himself again and sweetly
46622 In all the rest show'd a most noble patience
46623 SECOND GENTLEMAN I do not think he fears death
46624 FIRST GENTLEMAN Sure he does not
46625 He never was so womanish the cause
46626 He may a little grieve at
46627 SECOND GENTLEMAN Certainly
46628 The Cardinal is the end of this
46629 FIRST GENTLEMAN 'Tis likely
46630 By all conjectures first Kildare's attainder
46631 Then deputy of Ireland who remov'd
46632 Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too
46633 Lest he should help his father
46634 SECOND GENTLEMAN That trick of state
46635 Was a deep envious one
46636 FIRST GENTLEMAN At his return
46637 No doubt he will requite it This is noted
46638 And generally whoever the King favours
46639 The Cardinal instantly will find employment
46640 And far enough from court too
46641 SECOND GENTLEMAN All the commons
46642 Hate him perniciously and o my conscience
46643 Wish him ten fathom deep this Duke as much
46644 They love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham
46645 The mirror of all courtesy
46646 Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment tipstaves
46647 before him the axe with the edge towards him halberds
46648 on each side accompanied with SIR THOMAS
46649 LOVELL SIR NICHOLAS VAUX SIR WILLIAM SANDYS
46650 and common people etc
46651 FIRST GENTLEMAN Stay there sir
46652 And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of
46653 SECOND GENTLEMAN Let's stand close and behold him
46654 BUCKINGHAM All good people
46655 You that thus far have come to pity me
46656 Hear what I say and then go home and lose me
46657 I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment
46658 And by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
46659 And if I have a conscience let it sink me
46660 Even as the axe falls if I be not faithful
46661 The law I bear no malice for my death
46662 'T has done upon the premises but justice
46663 But those that sought it I could wish more Christians
46664 Be what they will I heartily forgive 'em
46665 Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief
46666 Nor build their evils on the graves of great men
46667 For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em
46668 For further life in this world I ne'er hope
46669 Nor will I sue although the King have mercies
46670 More than I dare make faults You few that lov'd me
46671 And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham
46672 His noble friends and fellows whom to leave
46673 Is only bitter to him only dying
46674 Go with me like good angels to my end
46675 And as the long divorce of steel falls on me
46676 Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
46677 And lift my soul to heaven Lead on a God's name
46678 LOVELL I do beseech your Grace for charity
46679 If ever any malice in your heart
46680 Were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
46681 BUCKINGHAM Sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you
46682 As I would be forgiven I forgive all
46683 There cannot be those numberless offences
46684 'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with No black envy
46685 Shall mark my grave Commend me to his Grace
46686 And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him
46687 You met him half in heaven My vows and prayers
46688 Yet are the King's and till my soul forsake
46689 Shall cry for blessings on him May he live
46690 Longer than I have time to tell his years
46691 Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be
46692 And when old time Shall lead him to his end
46693 Goodness and he fill up one monument
46694 LOVELL To th water side I must conduct your Grace
46695 Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux
46696 Who undertakes you to your end
46697 VAUX Prepare there
46698 The Duke is coming see the barge be ready
46699 And fit it with such furniture as suits
46700 The greatness of his person
46701 BUCKINGHAM Nay Sir Nicholas
46702 Let it alone my state now will but mock me
46703 When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
46704 And Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun
46705 Yet I am richer than my base accusers
46706 That never knew what truth meant I now seal it
46707 And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort
46708 My noble father Henry of Buckingham
46709 Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard
46710 Flying for succour to his servant Banister
46711 Being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd
46712 And without trial fell God's peace be with him
46713 Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying
46714 My father's loss like a most royal prince
46715 Restor'd me to my honours and out of ruins
46716 Made my name once more noble Now his son
46717 Henry the Eighth life honour name and all
46718 That made me happy at one stroke has taken
46719 For ever from the world I had my trial
46720 And must needs say a noble one which makes me
46721 A little happier than my wretched father
46722 Yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
46723 Fell by our servants by those men we lov'd most
46724 A most unnatural and faithless service
46725 Heaven has an end in all Yet you that hear me
46726 This from a dying man receive as certain
46727 Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
46728 Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
46729 And give your hearts to when they once perceive
46730 The least rub in your fortunes fall away
46731 Like water from ye never found again
46732 But where they mean to sink ye All good people
46733 Pray for me I must now forsake ye the last hour
46734 Of my long weary life is come upon me
46735 Farewell
46736 And when you would say something that is sad
46737 Speak how I fell I have done and God forgive me
46738 Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train
46739 FIRST GENTLEMAN O this is full of pity Sir it calls
46740 I fear too many curses on their heads
46741 That were the authors
46742 SECOND GENTLEMAN If the Duke be guiltless
46743 'Tis full of woe yet I can give you inkling
46744 Of an ensuing evil if it fall
46745 Greater than this
46746 FIRST GENTLEMAN Good angels keep it from us
46747 What may it be You do not doubt my faith sir
46748 SECOND GENTLEMAN This secret is so weighty 'twill require
46749 A strong faith to conceal it
46750 FIRST GENTLEMAN Let me have it
46751 I do not talk much
46752 SECOND GENTLEMAN I am confident
46753 You shall sir Did you not of late days hear
46754 A buzzing of a separation
46755 Between the King and Katharine
46756 FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes but it held not
46757 For when the King once heard it out of anger
46758 He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
46759 To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
46760 That durst disperse it
46761 SECOND GENTLEMAN But that slander sir
46762 Is found a truth now for it grows again
46763 Fresher than e'er it was and held for certain
46764 The King will venture at it Either the Cardinal
46765 Or some about him near have out of malice
46766 To the good Queen possess'd him with a scruple
46767 That will undo her To confirm this too
46768 Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately
46769 As all think for this business
46770 FIRST GENTLEMAN 'Tis the Cardinal
46771 And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
46772 For not bestowing on him at his asking
46773 The archbishopric of Toledo this is purpos'd
46774 SECOND GENTLEMAN I think you have hit the mark but is't
46775 not cruel
46776 That she should feel the smart of this The Cardinal
46777 Will have his will and she must fall
46778 FIRST GENTLEMAN 'Tis woeful
46779 We are too open here to argue this
46780 Let's think in private more Exeunt

46788 When they were ready to set out for London a man of
46789 my Lord Cardinal's by commission and main power took
46790 'em from me with this reason his master would be serv'd
46791 before a subject if not before the King which stopp'd

46804 SUFFOLK No his conscience
46805 Has crept too near another lady
46806 NORFOLK 'Tis so

46811 NORFOLK How holily he works in all his business
46812 And with what zeal For now he has crack'd the league
46813 Between us and the Emperor the Queen's great nephew
46814 He dives into the King's soul and there scatters
46815 Dangers doubts wringing of the conscience
46816 Fears and despairsand all these for his marriage
46817 And out of all these to restore the King
46818 He counsels a divorce a loss of her
46819 That like a jewel has hung twenty years
46820 About his neck yet never lost her lustre
46821 Of her that loves him with that excellence
46822 That angels love good men with even of her
46823 That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
46824 Will bless the Kingand is not this course pious
46825 CHAMBERLAIN Heaven keep me from such counsel 'Tis most true

46839 I love him not nor fear himthere's my creed
46840 As I am made without him so I'll stand
46841 If the King please his curses and his blessings
46842 Touch me alike th are breath I not believe in
46843 I knew him and I know him so I leave him
46844 To him that made him proudthe Pope

47264 That it shall please you to declare in hearing
47265 Of all these earsfor where I am robb'd and bound
47266 There must I be unloos'd although not there
47267 At once and fully satisfiedwhether ever I
47268 Did broach this business to your Highness or
47269 Laid any scruple in your way which might
47270 Induce you to the question on't or ever
47271 Have to you but with thanks to God for such
47272 A royal lady spake one the least word that might
47273 Be to the prejudice of her present state
47274 Or touch of her good person
47275 KING My Lord Cardinal
47276 I do excuse you yea upon mine honour
47277 I free you from't You are not to be taught
47278 That you have many enemies that know not
47279 Why they are so but like to village curs
47280 Bark when their fellows do By some of these
47281 The Queen is put in anger Y'are excus'd
47282 But will you be more justified You ever
47283 Have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desir'd
47284 It to be stirr'd but oft have hind'red oft
47285 The passages made toward it On my honour
47286 I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point
47287 And thus far clear him Now what mov'd me to't
47288 I will be bold with time and your attention
47289 Then mark th inducement Thus it camegive heed to't
47290 My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness
47291 Scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd
47292 By th Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador
47293 Who had been hither sent on the debating
47294 A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
47295 Our daughter Mary I th progress of this business
47296 Ere a determinate resolution he
47297 I mean the Bishopdid require a respite
47298 Wherein he might the King his lord advertise
47299 Whether our daughter were legitimate
47300 Respecting this our marriage with the dowager
47301 Sometimes our brother's wife This respite shook
47302 The bosom of my conscience enter'd me
47303 Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
47304 The region of my breast which forc'd such way
47305 That many maz'd considerings did throng
47306 And press'd in with this caution First methought
47307 I stood not in the smile of heaven who had
47308 Commanded nature that my lady's womb
47309 If it conceiv'd a male child by me should
47310 Do no more offices of life to't than
47311 The grave does to the dead for her male issue
47312 Or died where they were made or shortly after
47313 This world had air'd them Hence I took a thought
47314 This was a judgment on me that my kingdom
47315 Well worthy the best heir o th world should not
47316 Be gladded in't by me Then follows that
47317 I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
47318 By this my issue's fail and that gave to me
47319 Many a groaning throe Thus hulling in
47320 The wild sea of my conscience I did steer
47321 Toward this remedy whereupon we are
47322 Now present here together that's to say
47323 I meant to rectify my conscience which
47324 I then did feel full sick and yet not well
47325 By all the reverend fathers of the land
47326 And doctors learn'd First I began in private
47327 With you my Lord of Lincoln you remember
47328 How under my oppression I did reek
47329 When I first mov'd you
47330 LINCOLN Very well my liege
47331 KING I have spoke long be pleas'd yourself to say
47332 How far you satisfied me
47333 LINCOLN So please your Highness
47334 The question did at first so stagger me
47335 Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
47336 And consequence of dreadthat I committed
47337 The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt
47338 And did entreat your Highness to this course
47339 Which you are running here
47340 KING I then mov'd you
47341 My Lord of Canterbury and got your leave
47342 To make this present summons Unsolicited
47343 I left no reverend person in this court
47344 But by particular consent proceeded
47345 Under your hands and seals therefore go on
47346 For no dislike i th world against the person
47347 Of the good Queen but the sharp thorny points
47348 Of my alleged reasons drives this forward
47349 Prove but our marriage lawful by my life
47350 And kingly dignity we are contented
47351 To wear our moral state to come with her
47352 Katharine our queen before the primest creature
47353 That's paragon'd o th world
47354 CAMPEIUS So please your Highness
47355 The Queen being absent 'tis a needful fitness
47356 That we adjourn this court till further day
47357 Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
47358 Made to the Queen to call back her appeal
47359 She intends unto his Holiness
47360 KING [Aside] I may perceive
47361 These cardinals trifle with me I abhor
47362 This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome
47363 My learn'd and wellbeloved servant Cranmer
47364 Prithee return With thy approach I know
47365 My comfort comes along Break up the court
47366 I say set on Exuent in manner as they entered

47438 So deep suspicion where all faith was meant
47439 We come not by the way of accusation
47440 To taint that honour every good tongue blesses
47441 Nor to betray you any way to sorrow
47442 You have too much good lady but to know
47443 How you stand minded in the weighty difference
47444 Between the King and you and to deliver
47445 Like free and honest men our just opinions
47446 And comforts to your cause
47447 CAMPEIUS Most honour'd madam
47448 My Lord of York out of his noble nature
47449 Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace
47450 Forgetting like a good man your late censure
47451 Both of his truth and himwhich was too far
47452 Offers as I do in a sign of peace
47453 His service and his counsel
47454 QUEEN KATHARINE [Aside] To betray me
47455 My lords I thank you both for your good wins
47456 Ye speak like honest menpray God ye prove so
47457 But how to make ye suddenly an answer
47458 In such a point of weight so near mine honour
47459 More near my life I fear with my weak wit
47460 And to such men of gravity and learning
47461 In truth I know not I was set at work
47462 Among my maids full little God knows looking
47463 Either for such men or such business
47464 For her sake that I have beenfor I feel
47465 The last fit of my greatnessgood your Graces
47466 Let me have time and counsel for my cause
47467 Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless
47468 WOLSEY Madam you wrong the King's love with these fears
47469 Your hopes and friends are infinite
47470 QUEEN KATHARINE In England
47471 But little for my profit can you think lords
47472 That any Englishman dare give me counsel
47473 Or be a known friend 'gainst his Highness pleasure
47474 Though he be grown so desperate to be honest
47475 And live a subject Nay forsooth my friends
47476 They that must weigh out my afflictions
47477 They that my trust must grow to live not here
47478 They are as all my other comforts far hence
47479 In mine own country lords
47480 CAMPEIUS I would your Grace
47481 Would leave your griefs and take my counsel
47482 QUEEN KATHARINE How sir
47483 CAMPEIUS Put your main cause into the King's protection
47484 He's loving and most gracious 'Twill be much
47485 Both for your honour better and your cause
47486 For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
47487 You'll part away disgrac'd
47488 WOLSEY He tells you rightly
47489 QUEEN KATHARINE Ye tell me what ye wish for bothmy ruin
47490 Is this your Christian counsel Out upon ye
47491 Heaven is above all yet there sits a Judge
47492 That no king can corrupt
47493 CAMPEIUS Your rage mistakes us
47494 QUEEN KATHARINE The more shame for ye holy men I thought ye
47495 Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
47496 But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye
47497 Mend 'em for shame my lords Is this your comfort
47498 The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
47499 A woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd
47500 I will not wish ye half my miseries
47501 I have more charity but say I warned ye
47502 Take heed for heaven's sake take heed lest at once
47503 The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye
47504 WOLSEY Madam this is a mere distraction
47505 You turn the good we offer into envy
47506 QUEEN KATHARINE Ye turn me into nothing Woe upon ye
47507 And all such false professors Would you have me
47508 If you have any justice any pity
47509 If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits
47510 Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
47511 Alas has banish'd me his bed already
47512 His love too long ago I am old my lords
47513 And all the fellowship I hold now with him
47514 Is only my obedience What can happen
47515 To me above this wretchedness All your studies
47516 Make me a curse like this
47517 CAMPEIUS Your fears are worse
47518 QUEEN KATHARINE Have I liv'd thus longlet me speak myself
47519 Since virtue finds no friendsa wife a true one
47520 A woman I dare say without vainglory
47521 Never yet branded with suspicion
47522 Have I with all my full affections
47523 Still met the King lov'd him next heav'n obey'd him
47524 Been out of fondness superstitious to him
47525 Almost forgot my prayers to content him
47526 And am I thus rewarded 'Tis not well lords
47527 Bring me a constant woman to her husband
47528 One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure
47529 And to that woman when she has done most
47530 Yet will I add an honoura great patience
47531 WOLSEY Madam you wander from the good we aim at
47532 QUEEN KATHARINE My lord I dare not make myself so guilty
47533 To give up willingly that noble title
47534 Your master wed me to nothing but death
47535 Shall e'er divorce my dignities
47536 WOLSEY Pray hear me
47537 QUEEN KATHARINE Would I had never trod this English earth
47538 Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
47539 Ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts
47540 What will become of me now wretched lady
47541 I am the most unhappy woman living
47542 [To her WOMEN] Alas poor wenches where are now
47543 your fortunes
47544 Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity
47545 No friends no hope no kindred weep for me
47546 Almost no grave allow'd me Like the My
47547 That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd
47548 I'll hang my head and perish
47549 WOLSEY If your Grace
47550 Could but be brought to know our ends are honest
47551 You'd feel more comfort Why should we good lady
47552 Upon what cause wrong you Alas our places
47553 The way of our profession is against it
47554 We are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em
47555 For goodness sake consider what you do
47556 How you may hurt yourself ay utterly
47557 Grow from the King's acquaintance by this carriage
47558 The hearts of princes kiss obedience
47559 So much they love it but to stubborn spirits
47560 They swell and grow as terrible as storms
47561 I know you have a gentle noble temper
47562 A soul as even as a calm Pray think us
47563 Those we profess peacemakers friends and servants
47564 CAMPEIUS Madam you'll find it so You wrong your virtues
47565 With these weak women's fears A noble spirit
47566 As yours was put into you ever casts
47567 Such doubts as false coin from it The King loves you
47568 Beware you lose it not For us if you please
47569 To trust us in your business we are ready
47570 To use our utmost studies in your service
47571 QUEEN KATHARINE Do what ye will my lords and pray
47572 forgive me
47573 If I have us'd myself unmannerly
47574 You know I am a woman lacking wit
47575 To make a seemly answer to such persons
47576 Pray do my service to his Majesty
47577 He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
47578 While I shall have my life Come reverend fathers
47579 Bestow your counsels on me she now begs

47718 Our cause that she should lie i th bosom of
47719 Our hardrul'd King Again there is sprung up

47734 Stood here observing him Some strange commotion
47735 Is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
47736 Stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
47737 Then lays his finger on his temple straight
47738 Springs out into fast gait then stops again
47739 Strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
47740 His eye against the moon In most strange postures
47741 We have seen him set himself
47742 KING It may well be
47743 There is a mutiny in's mind This morning
47744 Papers of state he sent me to peruse
47745 As I requir'd and wot you what I found

47747 Forsooth an inventory thus importing
47748 The several parcels of his plate his treasure
47749 Rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
47750 I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
47751 Possession of a subject
47752 NORFOLK It's heaven's will
47753 Some spirit put this paper in the packet
47754 To bless your eye withal
47755 KING If we did think
47756 His contemplation were above the earth
47757 And fix'd on spiritual object he should still
47758 dwell in his musings but I am afraid
47759 His thinkings are below the moon not worth
47760 His serious considering
47761 [The KING takes his seat and whispers LOVELL
47762 who goes to the CARDINAL]
47763 WOLSEY Heaven forgive me
47764 Ever God bless your Highness

47802 My studied purposes requite which went
47803 Beyond all man's endeavours My endeavours

47805 Yet fil'd with my abilities mine own ends
47806 Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
47807 To th good of your most sacred person and

47821 On you than any so your hand and heart
47822 Your brain and every function of your power

47825 To me your friend than any
47826 WOLSEY I do profess
47827 That for your Highness good I ever labour'd
47828 More than mine own that am have and will be
47829 Though all the world should crack their duty to you
47830 And throw it from their soul though perils did
47831 Abound as thick as thought could make 'em and
47832 Appear in forms more horridyet my duty
47833 As doth a rock against the chiding flood
47834 Should the approach of this wild river break

47842 Exit the KING frowning upon the CARDINAL the NOBLES
47843 throng after him smiling and whispering
47844 WOLSEY What should this mean
47845 What sudden anger's this How have I reap'd it
47846 He parted frowning from me as if ruin
47847 Leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion
47848 Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him
47849 Then makes him nothing I must read this paper
47850 I fear the story of his anger 'Tis so
47851 This paper has undone me 'Tis th account
47852 Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
47853 For mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
47854 And fee my friends in Rome O negligence

47856 Made me put this main secret in the packet
47857 I sent the King Is there no way to cure this
47858 No new device to beat this from his brains
47859 I know 'twill stir him strongly yet I know
47860 A way if it take right in spite of fortune
47861 Will bring me off again What's this 'To th Pope'
47862 The letter as I live with all the business
47863 I writ to's Holiness Nay then farewell
47864 I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness

47893 Mine and your masterwith his own hand gave me
47894 Bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
47895 During my life and to confirm his goodness

47905 Of noble Buckingham my fatherinlaw
47906 The heads of all thy brother cardinals
47907 With thee and all thy best parts bound together
47908 Weigh'd not a hair of his Plague of your policy

47916 I answer is most false The Duke by law
47917 Found his deserts how innocent I was
47918 From any private malice in his end
47919 His noble jury and foul cause can witness
47920 If I lov'd many words lord I should tell you
47921 You have as little honesty as honour
47922 That in the way of loyalty and truth
47923 Toward the King my ever royal master

47925 And an that love his follies

47934 WOLSEY All goodness
47935 Is poison to thy stomach
47936 SURREY Yes that goodness
47937 Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
47938 Into your own hands Cardinal by extortion
47939 The goodness of your intercepted packets
47940 You writ to th Pope against the King your goodness
47941 Since you provoke me shall be most notorious
47942 My Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble
47943 As you respect the common good the state
47944 Of our despis'd nobility our issues
47945 Whom if he live will scarce be gentlemen
47946 Produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
47947 Collected from his life I'll startle you
47948 Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench
47949 Lay kissing in your arms Lord Cardinal
47950 WOLSEY How much methinks I could despise this man
47951 But that I am bound in charity against it
47952 NORFOLK Those articles my lord are in the King's hand
47953 But thus much they are foul ones
47954 WOLSEY So much fairer
47955 And spotless shall mine innocence arise
47956 When the King knows my truth
47957 SURREY This cannot save you
47958 I thank my memory I yet remember
47959 Some of these articles and out they shall
47960 Now if you can blush and cry guilty Cardinal
47961 You'll show a little honesty
47962 WOLSEY Speak on sir
47963 I dare your worst objections If I blush
47964 It is to see a nobleman want manners
47965 SURREY I had rather want those than my head Have at you
47966 First that without the King's assent or knowledge
47967 You wrought to be a legate by which power
47968 You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops
47969 NORFOLK Then that in all you writ to Rome or else
47970 To foreign princes 'Ego et Rex meus'
47971 Was still inscrib'd in which you brought the King
47972 To be your servant
47973 SUFFOLK Then that without the knowledge
47974 Either of King or Council when you went
47975 Ambassador to the Emperor you made bold
47976 To carry into Flanders the great seal
47977 SURREY Item you sent a large commission
47978 To Gregory de Cassado to conclude
47979 Without the King's will or the state's allowance
47980 A league between his Highness and Ferrara
47981 SUFFOLK That out of mere ambition you have caus'd
47982 Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin
47983 SURREY Then that you have sent innumerable substance
47984 By what means got I leave to your own conscience
47985 To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
47986 You have for dignities to the mere undoing
47987 Of all the kingdom Many more there are
47988 Which since they are of you and odious
47989 I will not taint my mouth with
47990 CHAMBERLAIN O my lord
47991 Press not a falling man too far 'Tis virtue
47992 His faults lie open to the laws let them
47993 Not you correct him My heart weeps to see him
47994 So little of his great self
47995 SURREY I forgive him
47996 SUFFOLK Lord Cardinal the King's further pleasure is
47997 Because all those things you have done of late
47998 By your power legatine within this kingdom
47999 Fall into th compass of a praemunire
48000 That therefore such a writ be sued against you
48001 To forfeit all your goods lands tenements
48002 Chattels and whatsoever and to be
48003 Out of the King's protection This is my charge
48004 NORFOLK And so we'll leave you to your meditations
48005 How to live better For your stubborn answer
48006 About the giving back the great seal to us
48007 The King shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
48008 So fare you well my little good Lord Cardinal
48009 Exeunt all but WOLSEY
48010 WOLSEY So farewell to the little good you bear me
48011 Farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
48012 This is the state of man today he puts forth
48013 The tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms
48014 And bears his blushing honours thick upon him
48015 The third day comes a frost a killing frost
48016 And when he thinks good easy man full surely
48017 His greatness is aripening nips his root
48018 And then he falls as I do I have ventur'd
48019 Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
48020 This many summers in a sea of glory
48021 But far beyond my depth My highblown pride
48022 At length broke under me and now has left me
48023 Weary and old with service to the mercy
48024 Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
48025 Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye
48026 I feel my heart new open'd O how wretched
48027 Is that poor man that hangs on princes favours
48028 There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
48029 That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
48030 More pangs and fears than wars or women have
48031 And when he falls he falls like Lucifer
48032 Never to hope again
48033 Enter CROMWELL standing amazed
48034 Why how now Cromwell
48035 CROMWELL I have no power to speak sir
48036 WOLSEY What amaz'd
48037 At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder
48038 A great man should decline Nay an you weep
48039 I am fall'n indeed
48040 CROMWELL How does your Grace
48041 WOLSEY Why well
48042 Never so truly happy my good Cromwell
48043 I know myself now and I feel within me
48044 A peace above all earthly dignities
48045 A still and quiet conscience The King has cur'd me
48046 I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders
48047 These ruin'd pillars out of pity taken
48048 A load would sink a navytoo much honour
48049 O 'tis a burden Cromwell 'tis a burden
48050 Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
48051 CROMWELL I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it
48052 WOLSEY I hope I have I am able now methinks
48053 Out of a fortitude of soul I feel
48054 To endure more miseries and greater far
48055 Than my weakhearted enemies dare offer
48056 What news abroad
48057 CROMWELL The heaviest and the worst
48058 Is your displeasure with the King
48059 WOLSEY God bless him
48060 CROMWELL The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
48061 Lord Chancellor in your place
48062 WOLSEY That's somewhat sudden
48063 But he's a learned man May he continue
48064 Long in his Highness favour and do justice
48065 For truth's sake and his conscience that his bones
48066 When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
48067 May have a tomb of orphans tears wept on him
48068 What more
48069 CROMWELL That Cranmer is return'd with welcome
48070 Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury
48071 WOLSEY That's news indeed
48072 CROMWELL Last that the Lady Anne
48073 Whom the King hath in secrecy long married
48074 This day was view'd in open as his queen
48075 Going to chapel and the voice is now
48076 Only about her coronation
48077 WOLSEY There was the weight that pull'd me down
48078 O Cromwell
48079 The King has gone beyond me All my glories
48080 In that one woman I have lost for ever
48081 No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
48082 Or gild again the noble troops that waited
48083 Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell
48084 I am a poor fall'n man unworthy now
48085 To be thy lord and master Seek the King
48086 That sun I pray may never set I have told him
48087 What and how true thou art He will advance thee
48088 Some little memory of me will stir him
48089 I know his noble naturenot to let
48090 Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell
48091 Neglect him not make use now and provide
48092 For thine own future safety
48093 CROMWELL O my lord
48094 Must I then leave you Must I needs forgo
48095 So good so noble and so true a master
48096 Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
48097 With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord
48098 The King shall have my service but my prayers
48099 For ever and for ever shall be yours
48100 WOLSEY Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear
48101 In all my miseries but thou hast forc'd me
48102 Out of thy honest truth to play the woman
48103 Let's dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell
48104 And when I am forgotten as I shall be
48105 And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
48106 Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee
48107 Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
48108 And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
48109 Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in
48110 A sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it
48111 Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me
48112 Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition
48113 By that sin fell the angels How can man then
48114 The image of his Maker hope to win by it
48115 Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
48116 Corruption wins not more than honesty
48117 Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
48118 To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not
48119 Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
48120 Thy God's and truth's then if thou fall'st O Cromwell
48121 Thou fall'st a blessed martyr
48122 Serve the King andprithee lead me in
48123 There take an inventory of all I have
48124 To the last penny 'tis the King's My robe
48125 And my integrity to heaven is all
48126 I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell
48127 Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal
48128 I serv'd my King he would not in mine age
48129 Have left me naked to mine enemies
48130 CROMWELL Good sir have patience
48131 WOLSEY So I have Farewell
48132 The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwell Exeunt

48178 From Ampthill where the Princess lay to which
48179 She was often cited by them but appear'd not
48180 And to be short for not appearance and
48181 The King's late scruple by the main assent
48182 Of all these learned men she was divorc'd

48242 Exit Procession with a great flourish of trumpets
48243 Enter a third GENTLEMAN
48244 God save you sir Where have you been broiling
48245 THIRD GENTLEMAN Among the crowds i th Abbey where a finger
48246 Could not be wedg'd in more I am stifled
48247 With the mere rankness of their joy
48248 SECOND GENTLEMAN You saw
48249 The ceremony
48250 THIRD GENTLEMAN That I did
48251 FIRST GENTLEMAN How was it
48252 THIRD GENTLEMAN Well worth the seeing
48253 SECOND GENTLEMAN Good sir speak it to us
48254 THIRD GENTLEMAN As well as I am able The rich stream
48255 Of lords and ladies having brought the Queen
48256 To a prepar'd place in the choir fell of
48257 A distance from her while her Grace sat down
48258 To rest awhile some half an hour or so
48259 In a rich chair of state opposing freely
48260 The beauty of her person to the people
48261 Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
48262 That ever lay by man which when the people
48263 Had the full view of such a noise arose
48264 As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
48265 As loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks
48266 Doublets I thinkflew up and had their faces
48267 Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy
48268 I never saw before Greatbellied women
48269 That had not half a week to go like rams
48270 In the old time of war would shake the press
48271 And make 'em reel before 'em No man living
48272 Could say 'This is my wife there all were woven
48273 So strangely in one piece
48274 SECOND GENTLEMAN But what follow'd
48275 THIRD GENTLEMAN At length her Grace rose and with
48276 modest paces
48277 Came to the altar where she kneel'd and saintlike
48278 Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly
48279 Then rose again and bow'd her to the people
48280 When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
48281 She had all the royal makings of a queen
48282 As holy oil Edward Confessor's crown
48283 The rod and bird of peace and all such emblems
48284 Laid nobly on her which perform'd the choir
48285 With all the choicest music of the kingdom
48286 Together sung 'Te Deum So she parted
48287 And with the same full state pac'd back again
48288 To York Place where the feast is held
48289 FIRST GENTLEMAN Sir
48290 You must no more call it York Place that's past
48291 For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost
48292 'Tis now the King's and called Whitehall
48293 THIRD GENTLEMAN I know it
48294 But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name
48295 Is fresh about me
48296 SECOND GENTLEMAN What two reverend bishops
48297 Were those that went on each side of the Queen
48298 THIRD GENTLEMAN Stokesly and Gardiner the one of Winchester
48299 Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary

48309 A man in much esteem with th King and truly
48310 A worthy friend The King has made him Master

48313 SECOND GENTLEMAN He will deserve more

48316 Is to th court and there ye shall be my guests
48317 Something I can command As I walk thither

48320 ACT IV SCENE 2
48321 Kimbolton
48322 Enter KATHARINE Dowager sick led between GRIFFITH her Gentleman Usher
48323 and PATIENCE her woman
48324 GRIFFITH How does your Grace
48325 KATHARINE O Griffith sick to death
48326 My legs like loaden branches bow to th earth
48327 Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair
48328 Sonow methinks I feel a little ease
48329 Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou led'st me
48330 That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey
48331 Was dead
48332 GRIFFITH Yes madam but I think your Grace
48333 Out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't
48334 KATHARINE Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died
48335 If well he stepp'd before me happily
48336 For my example
48337 GRIFFITH Well the voice goes madam
48338 For after the stout Earl Northumberland
48339 Arrested him at York and brought him forward
48340 As a man sorely tainted to his answer
48341 He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
48342 He could not sit his mule
48343 KATHARINE Alas poor man
48344 GRIFFITH At last with easy roads he came to Leicester
48345 Lodg'd in the abbey where the reverend abbot
48346 With all his covent honourably receiv'd him
48347 To whom he gave these words 'O father Abbot
48348 An old man broken with the storms of state
48349 Is come to lay his weary bones among ye
48350 Give him a little earth for charity'
48351 So went to bed where eagerly his sickness
48352 Pursu'd him still And three nights after this
48353 About the hour of eightwhich he himself
48354 Foretold should be his lastfull of repentance
48355 Continual meditations tears and sorrows
48356 He gave his honours to the world again
48357 His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
48358 KATHARINE So may he rest his faults lie gently on him
48359 Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him
48360 And yet with charity He was a man
48361 Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
48362 Himself with princes one that by suggestion
48363 Tied all the kingdom Simony was fair play
48364 His own opinion was his law I th presence
48365 He would say untruths and be ever double
48366 Both in his words and meaning He was never
48367 But where he meant to ruin pitiful
48368 His promises were as he then was mighty
48369 But his performance as he is now nothing
48370 Of his own body he was ill and gave
48371 The clergy ill example
48372 GRIFFITH Noble madam
48373 Men's evil manners live in brass their virtues
48374 We write in water May it please your Highness
48375 To hear me speak his good now
48376 KATHARINE Yes good Griffith
48377 I were malicious else
48378 GRIFFITH This Cardinal
48379 Though from an humble stock undoubtedly
48380 Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle
48381 He was a scholar and a ripe and good one
48382 Exceeding wise fairspoken and persuading
48383 Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not
48384 But to those men that sought him sweet as summer
48385 And though he were unsatisfied in getting
48386 Which was a sinyet in bestowing madam
48387 He was most princely ever witness for him
48388 Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you
48389 Ipswich and Oxford One of which fell with him
48390 Unwilling to outlive the good that did it
48391 The other though unfinish'd yet so famous
48392 So excellent in art and still so rising
48393 That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue
48394 His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him
48395 For then and not till then he felt himself
48396 And found the blessedness of being little
48397 And to add greater honours to his age
48398 Than man could give him he died fearing God
48399 KATHARINE After my death I wish no other herald
48400 No other speaker of my living actions
48401 To keep mine honour from corruption
48402 But such an honest chronicler as Griffith
48403 Whom I most hated living thou hast made me
48404 With thy religious truth and modesty
48405 Now in his ashes honour Peace be with him
48406 patience be near me still and set me lower
48407 I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith
48408 Cause the musicians play me that sad note
48409 I nam'd my knell whilst I sit meditating
48410 On that celestial harmony I go to
48411 [Sad and solemn music]
48412 GRIFFITH She is asleep Good wench let's sit down quiet
48413 For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience
48414 THE VISION
48415 Enter solemnly tripping one after another six
48416 PERSONAGES clad in white robes wearing on their
48417 heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their
48418 faces branches of bays or palm in their hands They
48419 first congee unto her then dance and at certain
48420 changes the first two hold a spare garland over her
48421 head at which the other four make reverent curtsies
48422 Then the two that held the garland deliver the

48783 The King's physician as he pass'd along

48786 This is of purpose laid by some that hate me
48787 God turn their hearts I never sought their malice

48801 KING Ha 'tis he indeed
48802 Is this the honour they do one another
48803 'Tis well there's one above 'em yet I had thought
48804 They had parted so much honesty among 'em
48805 At least good mannersas not thus to suffer
48806 A man of his place and so near our favour
48807 To dance attendance on their lordships pleasures
48808 And at the door too like a post with packets
48809 By holy Mary Butts there's knavery

48819 CROMWELL at lower end as secretary KEEPER at the door
48820 CHANCELLOR Speak to the business master secretary
48821 Why are we met in council
48822 CROMWELL Please your honours
48823 The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury
48824 GARDINER Has he had knowledge of it
48825 CROMWELL Yes
48826 NORFOLK Who waits there
48827 KEEPER Without my noble lords
48828 GARDINER Yes
48829 KEEPER My Lord Archbishop
48830 And has done half an hour to know your pleasures
48831 CHANCELLOR Let him come in
48832 KEEPER Your Grace may enter now
48833 CRANMER approaches the Council table
48834 CHANCELLOR My good Lord Archbishop I am very sorry
48835 To sit here at this present and behold
48836 That chair stand empty but we all are men
48837 In our own natures frail and capable
48838 Of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
48839 And want of wisdom you that best should teach us
48840 Have misdemean'd yourself and not a little
48841 Toward the King first then his laws in filling
48842 The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains
48843 For so we are inform'dwith new opinions
48844 Divers and dangerous which are heresies
48845 And not reform'd may prove pernicious
48846 GARDINER Which reformation must be sudden too
48847 My noble lords for those that tame wild horses
48848 Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle
48849 But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em
48850 Till they obey the manage If we suffer
48851 Out of our easiness and childish pity
48852 To one man's honour this contagious sickness
48853 Farewell all physic and what follows then
48854 Commotions uproars with a general taint
48855 Of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
48856 The upper Germany can dearly witness
48857 Yet freshly pitied in our memories
48858 CRANMER My good lords hitherto in all the progress
48859 Both of my life and office I have labour'd
48860 And with no little study that my teaching
48861 And the strong course of my authority
48862 Might go one way and safely and the end
48863 Was ever to do well Nor is there living
48864 I speak it with a single heart my lords
48865 A man that more detests more stirs against
48866 Both in his private conscience and his place
48867 Defacers of a public peace than I do
48868 Pray heaven the King may never find a heart
48869 With less allegiance in it Men that make
48870 Envy and crooked malice nourishment
48871 Dare bite the best I do beseech your lordships
48872 That in this case of justice my accusers
48873 Be what they will may stand forth face to face
48874 And freely urge against me
48875 SUFFOLK Nay my lord
48876 That cannot be you are a councillor
48877 And by that virtue no man dare accuse you
48878 GARDINER My lord because we have business of more moment
48879 We will be short with you 'Tis his Highness pleasure
48880 And our consent for better trial of you
48881 From hence you be committed to the Tower
48882 Where being but a private man again
48883 You shall know many dare accuse you boldly
48884 More than I fear you are provided for
48885 CRANMER Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you
48886 You are always my good friend if your will pass
48887 I shall both find your lordship judge and juror
48888 You are so merciful I see your end
48889 'Tis my undoing Love and meekness lord
48890 Become a churchman better than ambition
48891 Win straying souls with modesty again
48892 Cast none away That I shall clear myself
48893 Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
48894 I make as little doubt as you do conscience
48895 In doing daily wrongs I could say more
48896 But reverence to your calling makes me modest
48897 GARDINER My lord my lord you are a sectary
48898 That's the plain truth Your painted gloss discovers
48899 To men that understand you words and weakness
48900 CROMWELL My Lord of Winchester y'are a little
48901 By your good favour too sharp men so noble
48902 However faulty yet should find respect
48903 For what they have been 'tis a cruelty
48904 To load a falling man
48905 GARDINER Good Master Secretary
48906 I cry your honour mercy you may worst
48907 Of all this table say so
48908 CROMWELL Why my lord
48909 GARDINER Do not I know you for a favourer
48910 Of this new sect Ye are not sound
48911 CROMWELL Not sound
48912 GARDINER Not sound I say
48913 CROMWELL Would you were half so honest
48914 Men's prayers then would seek you not their fears
48915 GARDINER I shall remember this bold language
48916 CROMWELL Do
48917 Remember your bold life too
48918 CHANCELLOR This is too much
48919 Forbear for shame my lords
48920 GARDINER I have done
48921 CROMWELL And I
48922 CHANCELLOR Then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
48923 I take it by all voices that forthwith
48924 You be convey'd to th Tower a prisoner
48925 There to remain till the King's further pleasure
48926 Be known unto us Are you all agreed lords
48927 ALL We are
48928 CRANMER Is there no other way of mercy
48929 But I must needs to th Tower my lords
48930 GARDINER What other
48931 Would you expect You are strangely troublesome
48932 Let some o th guard be ready there
48933 Enter the guard
48934 CRANMER For me
48935 Must I go like a traitor thither
48936 GARDINER Receive him
48937 And see him safe i th Tower
48938 CRANMER Stay good my lords
48939 I have a little yet to say Look there my lords
48940 By virtue of that ring I take my cause
48941 Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
48942 To a most noble judge the King my master
48943 CHAMBERLAIN This is the King's ring
48944 SURREY 'Tis no counterfeit
48945 SUFFOLK 'Tis the right ring by heav'n I told ye all
48946 When we first put this dangerous stone arolling
48947 'Twould fall upon ourselves
48948 NORFOLK Do you think my lords
48949 The King will suffer but the little finger
48950 Of this man to be vex'd
48951 CHAMBERLAIN 'Tis now too certain
48952 How much more is his life in value with him
48953 Would I were fairly out on't
48954 CROMWELL My mind gave me
48955 In seeking tales and informations
48956 Against this manwhose honesty the devil
48957 And his disciples only envy at
48958 Ye blew the fire that burns ye Now have at ye
48959 Enter the KING frowning on them he takes his seat
48960 GARDINER Dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
48961 In daily thanks that gave us such a prince
48962 Not only good and wise but most religious
48963 One that in all obedience makes the church
48964 The chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
48965 That holy duty out of dear respect
48966 His royal self in judgment comes to hear
48967 The cause betwixt her and this great offender
48968 KING You were ever good at sudden commendations
48969 Bishop of Winchester But know I come not
48970 To hear such flattery now and in my presence
48971 They are too thin and bare to hide offences
48972 To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
48973 And think with wagging of your tongue to win me
48974 But whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for I'm sure
48975 Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
48976 [To CRANMER] Good man sit down Now let me see the proudest
48977 He that dares most but wag his finger at thee
48978 By all that's holy he had better starve
48979 Than but once think this place becomes thee not
48980 SURREY May it please your Grace
48981 KING No sir it does not please me
48982 I had thought I had had men of some understanding
48983 And wisdom of my Council but I find none
48984 Was it discretion lords to let this man
48985 This good manfew of you deserve that title
48986 This honest man wait like a lousy footboy
48987 At chamber door and one as great as you are
48988 Why what a shame was this Did my commission
48989 Bid ye so far forget yourselves I gave ye
48990 Power as he was a councillor to try him
48991 Not as a groom There's some of ye I see
48992 More out of malice than integrity
48993 Would try him to the utmost had ye mean
48994 Which ye shall never have while I live
48995 CHANCELLOR Thus far
48996 My most dread sovereign may it like your Grace
48997 To let my tongue excuse all What was purpos'd
48998 concerning his imprisonment was rather
48999 If there be faith in menmeant for his trial
49000 And fair purgation to the world than malice
49001 I'm sure in me
49002 KING Well well my lords respect him
49003 Take him and use him well he's worthy of it
49004 I will say thus much for him if a prince
49005 May be beholding to a subject
49006 Am for his love and service so to him
49007 Make me no more ado but all embrace him
49008 Be friends for shame my lords My Lord of Canterbury
49009 I have a suit which you must not deny me
49010 That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
49011 You must be godfather and answer for her
49012 CRANMER The greatest monarch now alive may glory
49013 In such an honour how may I deserve it
49014 That am a poor and humble subject to you
49015 KING Come come my lord you'd spare your spoons You
49016 shall have
49017 Two noble partners with you the old Duchess of Norfolk
49018 And Lady Marquis Dorset Will these please you
49019 Once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you

49023 CRANMER And let heaven
49024 Witness how dear I hold this confirmation
49025 KING Good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
49026 The common voice I see is verified
49027 Of thee which says thus 'Do my Lord of Canterbury
49028 A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever'
49029 Come lords we trifle time away I long

49221 THE EPILOGUE
49222 'Tis ten to one this play can never please
49223 All that are here Some come to take their ease
49224 And sleep an act or two but those we fear
49225 W'have frighted with our trumpets so 'tis clear
49226 They'll say 'tis nought others to hear the city
49227 Abus'd extremely and to cry 'That's witty'
49228 Which we have not done neither that I fear
49229 All the expected good w'are like to hear
49230 For this play at this time is only in
49231 The merciful construction of good women
49232 For such a one we show'd 'em If they smile
49233 And say 'twill do I know within a while
49234 All the best men are ours for 'tis ill hap
49235 If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap

49287 KING JOHN's palace
49288 Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR PEMBROKE ESSEX SALISBURY and others
49289 with CHATILLON
49290 KING JOHN Now say Chatillon what would France with us
49291 CHATILLON Thus after greeting speaks the King of France
49292 In my behaviour to the majesty
49293 The borrowed majesty of England here
49294 ELINOR A strange beginning 'borrowed majesty'
49295 KING JOHN Silence good mother hear the embassy
49296 CHATILLON Philip of France in right and true behalf
49297 Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son
49298 Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim
49299 To this fair island and the territories
49300 To Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine
49301 Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
49302 Which sways usurpingly these several titles
49303 And put the same into young Arthur's hand
49304 Thy nephew and right royal sovereign
49305 KING JOHN What follows if we disallow of this
49306 CHATILLON The proud control of fierce and bloody war
49307 To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld
49308 KING JOHN Here have we war for war and blood for blood
49309 Controlment for controlment so answer France
49310 CHATILLON Then take my king's defiance from my mouth
49311 The farthest limit of my embassy
49312 KING JOHN Bear mine to him and so depart in peace
49313 Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France
49314 For ere thou canst report I will be there
49315 The thunder of my cannon shall be heard
49316 So hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
49317 And sullen presage of your own decay
49318 An honourable conduct let him have
49319 Pembroke look to 't Farewell Chatillon
49320 Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE
49321 ELINOR What now my son Have I not ever said
49322 How that ambitious Constance would not cease
49323 Till she had kindled France and all the world
49324 Upon the right and party of her son
49325 This might have been prevented and made whole
49326 With very easy arguments of love
49327 Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
49328 With fearful bloody issue arbitrate
49329 KING JOHN Our strong possession and our right for us
49330 ELINOR Your strong possession much more than your right
49331 Or else it must go wrong with you and me
49332 So much my conscience whispers in your ear
49333 Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear
49334 Enter a SHERIFF
49335 ESSEX My liege here is the strangest controversy
49336 Come from the country to be judg'd by you
49337 That e'er I heard Shall I produce the men
49338 KING JOHN Let them approach Exit SHERIFF
49339 Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
49340 This expedition's charge
49341 Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE and PHILIP his bastard
49342 brother
49343 What men are you
49344 BASTARD Your faithful subject I a gentleman
49345 Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son
49346 As I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge
49347 A soldier by the honourgiving hand
49348 Of Coeurdelion knighted in the field
49349 KING JOHN What art thou
49350 ROBERT The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge
49351 KING JOHN Is that the elder and art thou the heir
49352 You came not of one mother then it seems
49353 BASTARD Most certain of one mother mighty king
49354 That is well known and as I think one father
49355 But for the certain knowledge of that truth
49356 I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother
49357 Of that I doubt as all men's children may
49358 ELINOR Out on thee rude man Thou dost shame thy mother
49359 And wound her honour with this diffidence
49360 BASTARD I madam No I have no reason for it
49361 That is my brother's plea and none of mine
49362 The which if he can prove 'a pops me out
49363 At least from fair five hundred pound a year
49364 Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land
49365 KING JOHN A good blunt fellow Why being younger born
49366 Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
49367 BASTARD I know not why except to get the land
49368 But once he slander'd me with bastardy
49369 But whe'er I be as true begot or no
49370 That still I lay upon my mother's head
49371 But that I am as well begot my liege
49372 Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me
49373 Compare our faces and be judge yourself
49374 If old Sir Robert did beget us both
49375 And were our father and this son like him
49376 O old Sir Robert father on my knee
49377 I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee
49378 KING JOHN Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
49379 ELINOR He hath a trick of Coeurdelion's face
49380 The accent of his tongue affecteth him
49381 Do you not read some tokens of my son
49382 In the large composition of this man
49383 KING JOHN Mine eye hath well examined his parts
49384 And finds them perfect Richard Sirrah speak
49385 What doth move you to claim your brother's land
49386 BASTARD Because he hath a halfface like my father
49387 With half that face would he have all my land
49388 A halffac'd groat five hundred pound a year
49389 ROBERT My gracious liege when that my father liv'd
49390 Your brother did employ my father much
49391 BASTARD Well sir by this you cannot get my land
49392 Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother
49393 ROBERT And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
49394 To Germany there with the Emperor
49395 To treat of high affairs touching that time
49396 Th advantage of his absence took the King
49397 And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's
49398 Where how he did prevail I shame to speak
49399 But truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
49400 Between my father and my mother lay
49401 As I have heard my father speak himself
49402 When this same lusty gentleman was got
49403 Upon his deathbed he by will bequeath'd
49404 His lands to me and took it on his death
49405 That this my mother's son was none of his
49406 And if he were he came into the world
49407 Full fourteen weeks before the course of time
49408 Then good my liege let me have what is mine
49409 My father's land as was my father's will
49410 KING JOHN Sirrah your brother is legitimate
49411 Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
49412 And if she did play false the fault was hers
49413 Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
49414 That marry wives Tell me how if my brother
49415 Who as you say took pains to get this son
49416 Had of your father claim'd this son for his
49417 In sooth good friend your father might have kept
49418 This calf bred from his cow from all the world
49419 In sooth he might then if he were my brother's
49420 My brother might not claim him nor your father
49421 Being none of his refuse him This concludes
49422 My mother's son did get your father's heir
49423 Your father's heir must have your father's land
49424 ROBERT Shall then my father's will be of no force
49425 To dispossess that child which is not his
49426 BASTARD Of no more force to dispossess me sir
49427 Than was his will to get me as I think
49428 ELINOR Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
49429 And like thy brother to enjoy thy land
49430 Or the reputed son of Coeurdelion
49431 Lord of thy presence and no land beside
49432 BASTARD Madam an if my brother had my shape
49433 And I had his Sir Robert's his like him
49434 And if my legs were two such ridingrods
49435 My arms such eelskins stuff'd my face so thin
49436 That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
49437 Lest men should say 'Look where threefarthings goes'
49438 And to his shape were heir to all this land
49439 Would I might never stir from off this place
49440 I would give it every foot to have this face
49441 I would not be Sir Nob in any case
49442 ELINOR I like thee well Wilt thou forsake thy fortune
49443 Bequeath thy land to him and follow me
49444 I am a soldier and now bound to France
49445 BASTARD Brother take you my land I'll take my chance
49446 Your face hath got five hundred pound a year
49447 Yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear
49448 Madam I'll follow you unto the death
49449 ELINOR Nay I would have you go before me thither
49450 BASTARD Our country manners give our betters way
49451 KING JOHN What is thy name
49452 BASTARD Philip my liege so is my name begun
49453 Philip good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son
49454 KING JOHN From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest
49455 Kneel thou down Philip but rise more great
49456 Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet
49457 BASTARD Brother by th mother's side give me your hand
49458 My father gave me honour yours gave land
49459 Now blessed be the hour by night or day
49460 When I was got Sir Robert was away
49461 ELINOR The very spirit of Plantagenet
49462 I am thy grandam Richard call me so
49463 BASTARD Madam by chance but not by truth what though
49464 Something about a little from the right
49465 In at the window or else o'er the hatch
49466 Who dares not stir by day must walk by night
49467 And have is have however men do catch
49468 Near or far off well won is still well shot
49469 And I am I howe'er I was begot
49470 KING JOHN Go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
49471 A landless knight makes thee a landed squire
49472 Come madam and come Richard we must speed
49473 For France for France for it is more than need
49474 BASTARD Brother adieu Good fortune come to thee
49475 For thou wast got i th way of honesty
49476 Exeunt all but the BASTARD
49477 A foot of honour better than I was
49478 But many a many foot of land the worse
49479 Well now can I make any Joan a lady
49480 'Good den Sir Richard''Godamercy fellow'
49481 And if his name be George I'll call him Peter
49482 For newmade honour doth forget men's names
49483 'Tis too respective and too sociable
49484 For your conversion Now your traveller
49485 He and his toothpick at my worship's mess
49486 And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd
49487 Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
49488 My picked man of countries 'My dear sir'
49489 Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
49490 'I shall beseech you'That is question now
49491 And then comes answer like an Absey book
49492 'O sir says answer 'at your best command
49493 At your employment at your service sir'
49494 'No sir says question 'I sweet sir at yours'
49495 And so ere answer knows what question would
49496 Saving in dialogue of compliment
49497 And talking of the Alps and Apennines
49498 The Pyrenean and the river Po
49499 It draws toward supper in conclusion so
49500 But this is worshipful society
49501 And fits the mounting spirit like myself
49502 For he is but a bastard to the time
49503 That doth not smack of observation
49504 And so am I whether I smack or no
49505 And not alone in habit and device
49506 Exterior form outward accoutrement
49507 But from the inward motion to deliver
49508 Sweet sweet sweet poison for the age's tooth
49509 Which though I will not practise to deceive
49510 Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn
49511 For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
49512 But who comes in such haste in ridingrobes
49513 What womanpost is this Hath she no husband
49514 That will take pains to blow a horn before her
49515 Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and JAMES GURNEY

49537 We know his handiwork Therefore good mother
49538 To whom am I beholding for these limbs
49539 Sir Robert never holp to make this leg
49540 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Hast thou conspired with thy brother too

49552 LADY FAULCONBRIDGE King Richard Coeurdelion was thy father
49553 By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd
49554 To make room for him in my husband's bed
49555 Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
49556 Thou art the issue of my dear offence
49557 Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence
49558 BASTARD Now by this light were I to get again

49560 Some sins do bear their privilege on earth
49561 And so doth yours your fault was not your folly
49562 Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
49563 Subjected tribute to commanding love
49564 Against whose fury and unmatched force
49565 The aweless lion could not wage the fight
49566 Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand
49567 He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
49568 May easily win a woman's Ay my mother
49569 With all my heart I thank thee for my father

49604 Welcome before the gates of Angiers Duke
49605 KING PHILIP A noble boy Who would not do thee right
49606 AUSTRIA Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
49607 As seal to this indenture of my love
49608 That to my home I will no more return
49609 Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France
49610 Together with that pale that whitefac'd shore
49611 Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
49612 And coops from other lands her islanders
49613 Even till that England hedg'd in with the main
49614 That waterwalled bulwark still secure
49615 And confident from foreign purposes

49627 To cull the plots of best advantages
49628 We'll lay before this town our royal bones
49629 Wade to the marketplace in Frenchmen's blood

49642 CHATILLON Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
49643 And stir them up against a mightier task
49644 England impatient of your just demands
49645 Hath put himself in arms The adverse winds

49657 Have sold their fortunes at their native homes
49658 Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
49659 To make a hazard of new fortunes here
49660 In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
49661 Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
49662 Did never float upon the swelling tide
49663 To do offence and scathe in Christendom [Drum beats]
49664 The interruption of their churlish drums
49665 Cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
49666 To parley or to fight therefore prepare
49667 KING PHILIP How much unlook'd for is this expedition
49668 AUSTRIA By how much unexpected by so much

49680 From France to England there to live in peace
49681 England we love and for that England's sake
49682 With burden of our armour here we sweat
49683 This toil of ours should be a work of thine
49684 But thou from loving England art so far
49685 That thou hast underwrought his lawful king
49686 Cut off the sequence of posterity
49687 Outfaced infant state and done a rape
49688 Upon the maiden virtue of the crown

49694 That Geffrey was thy elder brother born
49695 And this his son England was Geffrey's right
49696 And this is Geffrey's In the name of God
49697 How comes it then that thou art call'd a king
49698 When living blood doth in these temples beat
49699 Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest
49700 KING JOHN From whom hast thou this great commission France
49701 To draw my answer from thy articles
49702 KING PHILIP From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
49703 In any breast of strong authority
49704 To look into the blots and stains of right
49705 That judge hath made me guardian to this boy

49737 But ass I'll take that burden from your back
49738 Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
49739 AUSTRIA What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
49740 With this abundance of superfluous breath

49759 I am not worth this coil that's made for me
49760 ELINOR His mother shames him so poor boy he weeps

49795 Whose title they admit Arthur's or John's
49796 Trumpet sounds Enter citizens upon the walls
49797 CITIZEN Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls
49798 KING PHILIP 'Tis France for England
49799 KING JOHN England for itself
49800 You men of Angiers and my loving subjects
49801 KING PHILIP You loving men of Angiers Arthur's subjects
49802 Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle
49803 KING JOHN For our advantage therefore hear us first
49804 These flags of France that are advanced here
49805 Before the eye and prospect of your town
49806 Have hither march'd to your endamagement
49807 The cannons have their bowels full of wrath
49808 And ready mounted are they to spit forth
49809 Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls
49810 All preparation for a bloody siege
49811 And merciless proceeding by these French
49812 Confront your city's eyes your winking gates
49813 And but for our approach those sleeping stones
49814 That as a waist doth girdle you about
49815 By the compulsion of their ordinance
49816 By this time from their fixed beds of lime
49817 Had been dishabited and wide havoc made
49818 For bloody power to rush upon your peace
49819 But on the sight of us your lawful king
49820 Who painfully with much expedient march
49821 Have brought a countercheck before your gates
49822 To save unscratch'd your city's threat'ned cheeks
49823 Behold the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle
49824 And now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire
49825 To make a shaking fever in your walls
49826 They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
49827 To make a faithless error in your cars
49828 Which trust accordingly kind citizens
49829 And let us inyour King whose labour'd spirits
49830 Forwearied in this action of swift speed
49831 Craves harbourage within your city walls
49832 KING PHILIP When I have said make answer to us both
49833 Lo in this right hand whose protection
49834 Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
49835 Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet
49836 Son to the elder brother of this man
49837 And king o'er him and all that he enjoys
49838 For this downtrodden equity we tread
49839 In warlike march these greens before your town
49840 Being no further enemy to you
49841 Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
49842 In the relief of this oppressed child
49843 Religiously provokes Be pleased then
49844 To pay that duty which you truly owe
49845 To him that owes it namely this young prince
49846 And then our arms like to a muzzled bear
49847 Save in aspect hath all offence seal'd up
49848 Our cannons malice vainly shall be spent
49849 Against th invulnerable clouds of heaven
49850 And with a blessed and unvex'd retire
49851 With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd
49852 We will bear home that lusty blood again
49853 Which here we came to spout against your town
49854 And leave your children wives and you in peace
49855 But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
49856 'Tis not the roundure of your oldfac'd walls
49857 Can hide you from our messengers of war
49858 Though all these English and their discipline
49859 Were harbour'd in their rude circumference
49860 Then tell us shall your city call us lord
49861 In that behalf which we have challeng'd it
49862 Or shall we give the signal to our rage
49863 And stalk in blood to our possession
49864 CITIZEN In brief we are the King of England's subjects
49865 For him and in his right we hold this town
49866 KING JOHN Acknowledge then the King and let me in
49867 CITIZEN That can we not but he that proves the King
49868 To him will we prove loyal Till that time
49869 Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world
49870 KING JOHN Doth not the crown of England prove the King
49871 And if not that I bring you witnesses
49872 Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed
49873 BASTARD Bastards and else
49874 KING JOHN To verify our title with their lives
49875 KING PHILIP As many and as wellborn bloods as those
49876 BASTARD Some bastards too
49877 KING PHILIP Stand in his face to contradict his claim
49878 CITIZEN Till you compound whose right is worthiest
49879 We for the worthiest hold the right from both
49880 KING JOHN Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
49881 That to their everlasting residence
49882 Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
49883 In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king
49884 KING PHILIP Amen Amen Mount chevaliers to arms
49885 BASTARD Saint George that swing'd the dragon and e'er since
49886 Sits on's horse back at mine hostess door
49887 Teach us some fence [To AUSTRIA] Sirrah were I at home
49888 At your den sirrah with your lioness
49889 I would set an oxhead to your lion's hide
49890 And make a monster of you
49891 AUSTRIA Peace no more
49892 BASTARD O tremble for you hear the lion roar
49893 KING JOHN Up higher to the plain where we'll set forth
49894 In best appointment all our regiments
49895 BASTARD Speed then to take advantage of the field
49896 KING PHILIP It shall be so and at the other hill
49897 Command the rest to stand God and our right Exeunt
49898 Here after excursions enter the HERALD OF FRANCE
49899 with trumpets to the gates
49900 FRENCH HERALD You men of Angiers open wide your gates
49901 And let young Arthur Duke of Britaine in
49902 Who by the hand of France this day hath made
49903 Much work for tears in many an English mother
49904 Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
49905 Many a widow's husband grovelling lies
49906 Coldly embracing the discoloured earth
49907 And victory with little loss doth play
49908 Upon the dancing banners of the French
49909 Who are at hand triumphantly displayed
49910 To enter conquerors and to proclaim
49911 Arthur of Britaine England's King and yours
49912 Enter ENGLISH HERALD with trumpet
49913 ENGLISH HERALD Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells
49914 King John your king and England's doth approach
49915 Commander of this hot malicious day
49916 Their armours that march'd hence so silverbright
49917 Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood
49918 There stuck no plume in any English crest
49919 That is removed by a staff of France
49920 Our colours do return in those same hands
49921 That did display them when we first march'd forth
49922 And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
49923 Our lusty English all with purpled hands
49924 Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes
49925 Open your gates and give the victors way
49926 CITIZEN Heralds from off our tow'rs we might behold
49927 From first to last the onset and retire
49928 Of both your armies whose equality
49929 By our best eyes cannot be censured
49930 Blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows
49931 Strength match'd with strength and power confronted power
49932 Both are alike and both alike we like
49933 One must prove greatest While they weigh so even
49934 We hold our town for neither yet for both
49935 Enter the two KINGS with their powers at several doors
49936 KING JOHN France hast thou yet more blood to cast away
49937 Say shall the current of our right run on
49938 Whose passage vex'd with thy impediment
49939 Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
49940 With course disturb'd even thy confining shores
49941 Unless thou let his silver water keep
49942 A peaceful progress to the ocean
49943 KING PHILIP England thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood
49944 In this hot trial more than we of France
49945 Rather lost more And by this hand I swear
49946 That sways the earth this climate overlooks
49947 Before we will lay down our justborne arms
49948 We'll put thee down 'gainst whom these arms we bear
49949 Or add a royal number to the dead
49950 Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
49951 With slaughter coupled to the name of kings
49952 BASTARD Ha majesty how high thy glory tow'rs
49953 When the rich blood of kings is set on fire
49954 O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel
49955 The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
49956 And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
49957 In undetermin'd differences of kings
49958 Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
49959 Cry 'havoc kings back to the stained field
49960 You equal potents fiery kindled spirits
49961 Then let confusion of one part confirm
49962 The other's peace Till then blows blood and death
49963 KING JOHN Whose party do the townsmen yet admit
49964 KING PHILIP Speak citizens for England who's your king
49965 CITIZEN The King of England when we know the King
49966 KING PHILIP Know him in us that here hold up his right
49967 KING JOHN In us that are our own great deputy
49968 And bear possession of our person here
49969 Lord of our presence Angiers and of you
49970 CITIZEN A greater pow'r than we denies all this
49971 And till it be undoubted we do lock
49972 Our former scruple in our strongbarr'd gates
49973 King'd of our fears until our fears resolv'd
49974 Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd
49975 BASTARD By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings
49976 And stand securely on their battlements
49977 As in a theatre whence they gape and point
49978 At your industrious scenes and acts of death
49979 Your royal presences be rul'd by me
49980 Do like the mutines of Jerusalem
49981 Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
49982 Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
49983 By east and west let France and England mount
49984 Their battering cannon charged to the mouths
49985 Till their soulfearing clamours have brawl'd down
49986 The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
49987 I'd play incessantly upon these jades
49988 Even till unfenced desolation
49989 Leave them as naked as the vulgar air
49990 That done dissever your united strengths
49991 And part your mingled colours once again
49992 Turn face to face and bloody point to point
49993 Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
49994 Out of one side her happy minion
49995 To whom in favour she shall give the day
49996 And kiss him with a glorious victory
49997 How like you this wild counsel mighty states
49998 Smacks it not something of the policy
49999 KING JOHN Now by the sky that hangs above our heads
50000 I like it well France shall we knit our pow'rs
50001 And lay this Angiers even with the ground
50002 Then after fight who shall be king of it
50003 BASTARD An if thou hast the mettle of a king
50004 Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town
50005 Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
50006 As we will ours against these saucy walls
50007 And when that we have dash'd them to the ground
50008 Why then defy each other and pellmell
50009 Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
50010 KING PHILIP Let it be so Say where will you assault
50011 KING JOHN We from the west will send destruction
50012 Into this city's bosom
50013 AUSTRIA I from the north
50014 KING PHILIP Our thunder from the south
50015 Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
50016 BASTARD [Aside] O prudent discipline From north to south
50017 Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth
50018 I'll stir them to itCome away away
50019 CITIZEN Hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
50020 And I shall show you peace and fairfac'd league
50021 Win you this city without stroke or wound
50022 Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
50023 That here come sacrifices for the field
50024 Persever not but hear me mighty kings
50025 KING JOHN Speak on with favour we are bent to hear
50026 CITIZEN That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch
50027 Is niece to England look upon the years
50028 Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid
50029 If lusty love should go in quest of beauty
50030 Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch
50031 If zealous love should go in search of virtue
50032 Where should he find it purer than in Blanch
50033 If love ambitious sought a match of birth
50034 Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch
50035 Such as she is in beauty virtue birth
50036 Is the young Dauphin every way complete
50037 If not complete of say he is not she
50038 And she again wants nothing to name want
50039 If want it be not that she is not he
50040 He is the half part of a blessed man
50041 Left to be finished by such as she
50042 And she a fair divided excellence
50043 Whose fulness of perfection lies in him
50044 O two such silver currents when they join
50045 Do glorify the banks that bound them in
50046 And two such shores to two such streams made one
50047 Two such controlling bounds shall you be Kings
50048 To these two princes if you marry them
50049 This union shall do more than battery can
50050 To our fastclosed gates for at this match
50051 With swifter spleen than powder can enforce
50052 The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
50053 And give you entrance but without this match
50054 The sea enraged is not half so deaf
50055 Lions more confident mountains and rocks
50056 More free from motionno not Death himself
50057 In mortal fury half so peremptory
50058 As we to keep this city
50059 BASTARD Here's a stay
50060 That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
50061 Out of his rags Here's a large mouth indeed
50062 That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
50063 Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
50064 As maids of thirteen do of puppydogs
50065 What cannoneer begot this lusty blood
50066 He speaks plain cannonfire and smoke and bounce
50067 He gives the bastinado with his tongue
50068 Our ears are cudgell'd not a word of his
50069 But buffets better than a fist of France
50070 Zounds I was never so bethump'd with words
50071 Since I first call'd my brother's father dad
50072 ELINOR Son list to this conjunction make this match
50073 Give with our niece a dowry large enough
50074 For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
50075 Thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown
50076 That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
50077 The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
50078 I see a yielding in the looks of France
50079 Mark how they whisper Urge them while their souls
50080 Are capable of this ambition
50081 Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
50082 Of soft petitions pity and remorse
50083 Cool and congeal again to what it was
50084 CITIZEN Why answer not the double majesties
50085 This friendly treaty of our threat'ned town
50086 KING PHILIP Speak England first that hath been forward first
50087 To speak unto this city what say you
50088 KING JOHN If that the Dauphin there thy princely son
50089 Can in this book of beauty read 'I love'
50090 Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
50091 For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers
50092 And all that we upon this side the sea
50093 Except this city now by us besieg'd
50094 Find liable to our crown and dignity
50095 Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
50096 In titles honours and promotions
50097 As she in beauty education blood
50098 Holds hand with any princess of the world
50099 KING PHILIP What say'st thou boy Look in the lady's face
50100 LEWIS I do my lord and in her eye I find
50101 A wonder or a wondrous miracle
50102 The shadow of myself form'd in her eye
50103 Which being but the shadow of your son
50104 Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
50105 I do protest I never lov'd myself
50106 Till now infixed I beheld myself
50107 Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
50108 [Whispers with BLANCH]
50109 BASTARD [Aside] Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
50110 Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow
50111 And quarter'd in her hearthe doth espy
50112 Himself love's traitor This is pity now
50113 That hang'd and drawn and quarter'd there should be
50114 In such a love so vile a lout as he
50115 BLANCH My uncle's will in this respect is mine
50116 If he see aught in you that makes him like
50117 That anything he sees which moves his liking
50118 I can with ease translate it to my will
50119 Or if you will to speak more properly
50120 I will enforce it eas'ly to my love
50121 Further I will not flatter you my lord
50122 That all I see in you is worthy love
50123 Than this that nothing do I see in you
50124 Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge
50125 That I can find should merit any hate
50126 KING JOHN What say these young ones What say you my niece
50127 BLANCH That she is bound in honour still to do
50128 What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
50129 KING JOHN Speak then Prince Dauphin can you love this lady
50130 LEWIS Nay ask me if I can refrain from love
50131 For I do love her most unfeignedly
50132 KING JOHN Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine
50133 Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces
50134 With her to thee and this addition more
50135 Full thirty thousand marks of English coin
50136 Philip of France if thou be pleas'd withal
50137 Command thy son and daughter to join hands
50138 KING PHILIP It likes us well young princes close your hands
50139 AUSTRIA And your lips too for I am well assur'd
50140 That I did so when I was first assur'd
50141 KING PHILIP Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates
50142 Let in that amity which you have made
50143 For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
50144 The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd
50145 Is not the Lady Constance in this troop
50146 I know she is not for this match made up
50147 Her presence would have interrupted much
50148 Where is she and her son Tell me who knows
50149 LEWIS She is sad and passionate at your Highness tent
50150 KING PHILIP And by my faith this league that we have made
50151 Will give her sadness very little cure
50152 Brother of England how may we content
50153 This widow lady In her right we came
50154 Which we God knows have turn'd another way
50155 To our own vantage
50156 KING JOHN We will heal up all
50157 For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine
50158 And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town
50159 We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance
50160 Some speedy messenger bid her repair
50161 To our solemnity I trust we shall
50162 If not fill up the measure of her will
50163 Yet in some measure satisfy her so
50164 That we shall stop her exclamation
50165 Go we as well as haste will suffer us
50166 To this unlook'dfor unprepared pomp
50167 Exeunt all but the BASTARD
50168 BASTARD Mad world mad kings mad composition
50169 John to stop Arthur's tide in the whole
50170 Hath willingly departed with a part
50171 And France whose armour conscience buckled on
50172 Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
50173 As God's own soldier rounded in the ear
50174 With that same purposechanger that sly devil
50175 That broker that still breaks the pate of faith
50176 That daily breakvow he that wins of all
50177 Of kings of beggars old men young men maids
50178 Who having no external thing to lose
50179 But the word 'maid cheats the poor maid of that
50180 That smoothfac'd gentleman tickling commodity
50181 Commodity the bias of the world
50182 The world who of itself is peised well
50183 Made to run even upon even ground
50184 Till this advantage this viledrawing bias
50185 This sway of motion this commodity
50186 Makes it take head from all indifferency
50187 From all direction purpose course intent
50188 And this same bias this commodity
50189 This bawd this broker this allchanging word
50190 Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France
50191 Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid
50192 From a resolv'd and honourable war
50193 To a most base and vileconcluded peace
50194 And why rail I on this commodity
50195 But for because he hath not woo'd me yet
50196 Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
50197 When his fair angels would salute my palm
50198 But for my hand as unattempted yet
50199 Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
50200 Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail
50201 And say there is no sin but to be rich
50202 And being rich my virtue then shall be
50203 To say there is no vice but beggary
50204 Since kings break faith upon commodity
50205 Gain be my lord for I will worship thee Exit

50215 France The FRENCH KING'S camp
50216 Enter CONSTANCE ARTHUR and SALISBURY
50217 CONSTANCE Gone to be married Gone to swear a peace
50218 False blood to false blood join'd Gone to be friends
50219 Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces
50220 It is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
50221 Be well advis'd tell o'er thy tale again
50222 It cannot be thou dost but say 'tis so
50223 I trust I may not trust thee for thy word
50224 Is but the vain breath of a common man
50225 Believe me I do not believe thee man
50226 I have a king's oath to the contrary
50227 Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
50228 For I am sick and capable of fears
50229 Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears
50230 A widow husbandless subject to fears
50231 A woman naturally born to fears
50232 And though thou now confess thou didst but jest
50233 With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce
50234 But they will quake and tremble all this day
50235 What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
50236 Why dost thou look so sadly on my son
50237 What means that hand upon that breast of thine
50238 Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
50239 Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds
50240 Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
50241 Then speak againnot all thy former tale
50242 But this one word whether thy tale be true
50243 SALISBURY As true as I believe you think them false
50244 That give you cause to prove my saying true
50245 CONSTANCE O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
50246 Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
50247 And let belief and life encounter so
50248 As doth the fury of two desperate men
50249 Which in the very meeting fall and die
50250 Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou
50251 France friend with England what becomes of me
50252 Fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight
50253 This news hath made thee a most ugly man
50254 SALISBURY What other harm have I good lady done
50255 But spoke the harm that is by others done
50256 CONSTANCE Which harm within itself so heinous is
50257 As it makes harmful all that speak of it
50258 ARTHUR I do beseech you madam be content
50259 CONSTANCE If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim
50260 Ugly and sland'rous to thy mother's womb
50261 Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
50262 Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
50263 Patch'd with foul moles and eyeoffending marks
50264 I would not care I then would be content
50265 For then I should not love thee no nor thou
50266 Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
50267 But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
50268 Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great
50269 Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
50270 And with the halfblown rose but Fortune O
50271 She is corrupted chang'd and won from thee
50272 Sh adulterates hourly with thine uncle John
50273 And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
50274 To tread down fair respect of sovereignty
50275 And made his majesty the bawd to theirs
50276 France is a bawd to Fortune and King John
50277 That strumpet Fortune that usurping John
50278 Tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn
50279 Envenom him with words or get thee gone
50280 And leave those woes alone which I alone
50281 Am bound to underbear
50282 SALISBURY Pardon me madam
50283 I may not go without you to the kings
50284 CONSTANCE Thou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee
50285 I will instruct my sorrows to be proud
50286 For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
50287 To me and to the state of my great grief
50288 Let kings assemble for my grief's so great
50289 That no supporter but the huge firm earth
50290 Can hold it up [Seats herself on the ground]
50291 Here I and sorrows sit
50292 Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it

50296 Ever in France shall be kept festival
50297 To solemnize this day the glorious sun
50298 Stays in his course and plays the alchemist
50299 Turning with splendour of his precious eye
50300 The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
50301 The yearly course that brings this day about
50302 Shall never see it but a holiday
50303 CONSTANCE [Rising] A wicked day and not a holy day
50304 What hath this day deserv'd what hath it done
50305 That it in golden letters should be set
50306 Among the high tides in the calendar
50307 Nay rather turn this day out of the week
50308 This day of shame oppression perjury
50309 Or if it must stand still let wives with child
50310 Pray that their burdens may not fall this day
50311 Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd
50312 But on this day let seamen fear no wreck
50313 No bargains break that are not this day made
50314 This day all things begun come to ill end
50315 Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
50316 KING PHILIP By heaven lady you shall have no cause
50317 To curse the fair proceedings of this day
50318 Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty
50319 CONSTANCE You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
50320 Resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried
50321 Proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
50322 You came in arms to spill mine enemies blood
50323 But now in arms you strengthen it with yours
50324 The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
50325 Is cold in amity and painted peace
50326 And our oppression hath made up this league
50327 Arm arm you heavens against these perjur'd kings
50328 A widow cries Be husband to me heavens
50329 Let not the hours of this ungodly day
50330 Wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
50331 Set armed discord 'twixt these perjur'd kings
50332 Hear me O hear me
50333 AUSTRIA Lady Constance peace
50334 CONSTANCE War war no peace Peace is to me a war
50335 O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame
50336 That bloody spoil Thou slave thou wretch thou coward
50337 Thou little valiant great in villainy
50338 Thou ever strong upon the stronger side
50339 Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
50340 But when her humorous ladyship is by
50341 To teach thee safety Thou art perjur'd too
50342 And sooth'st up greatness What a fool art thou
50343 A ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
50344 Upon my party Thou coldblooded slave
50345 Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
50346 Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
50347 Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
50348 And dost thou now fall over to my foes

50351 AUSTRIA O that a man should speak those words to me
50352 BASTARD And hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs

50354 BASTARD And hang a calf'sskin on those recreant limbs
50355 KING JOHN We like not this thou dost forget thyself
50356 Enter PANDULPH
50357 KING PHILIP Here comes the holy legate of the Pope
50358 PANDULPH Hail you anointed deputies of heaven
50359 To thee King John my holy errand is
50360 I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal
50361 And from Pope Innocent the legate here
50362 Do in his name religiously demand
50363 Why thou against the Church our holy mother
50364 So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
50365 Keep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop
50366 Of Canterbury from that holy see
50367 This in our foresaid holy father's name
50368 Pope Innocent I do demand of thee
50369 KING JOHN What earthly name to interrogatories
50370 Can task the free breath of a sacred king
50371 Thou canst not Cardinal devise a name
50372 So slight unworthy and ridiculous
50373 To charge me to an answer as the Pope
50374 Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England
50375 Add thus much more that no Italian priest
50376 Shall tithe or toll in our dominions
50377 But as we under heaven are supreme head
50378 So under Him that great supremacy
50379 Where we do reign we will alone uphold
50380 Without th assistance of a mortal hand
50381 So tell the Pope all reverence set apart
50382 To him and his usurp'd authority
50383 KING PHILIP Brother of England you blaspheme in this
50384 KING JOHN Though you and all the kings of Christendom
50385 Are led so grossly by this meddling priest
50386 Dreading the curse that money may buy out
50387 And by the merit of vile gold dross dust
50388 Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
50389 Who in that sale sells pardon from himself
50390 Though you and all the rest so grossly led
50391 This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
50392 Yet I alone alone do me oppose
50393 Against the Pope and count his friends my foes
50394 PANDULPH Then by the lawful power that I have
50395 Thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate
50396 And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
50397 From his allegiance to an heretic
50398 And meritorious shall that hand be call'd
50399 Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint
50400 That takes away by any secret course
50401 Thy hateful life
50402 CONSTANCE O lawful let it be
50403 That I have room with Rome to curse awhile
50404 Good father Cardinal cry thou 'amen'
50405 To my keen curses for without my wrong
50406 There is no tongue hath power to curse him right
50407 PANDULPH There's law and warrant lady for my curse
50408 CONSTANCE And for mine too when law can do no right
50409 Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
50410 Law cannot give my child his kingdom here
50411 For he that holds his kingdom holds the law
50412 Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
50413 How can the law forbid my tongue to curse
50414 PANDULPH Philip of France on peril of a curse
50415 Let go the hand of that archheretic
50416 And raise the power of France upon his head
50417 Unless he do submit himself to Rome
50418 ELINOR Look'st thou pale France Do not let go thy hand
50419 CONSTANCE Look to that devil lest that France repent
50420 And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
50421 AUSTRIA King Philip listen to the Cardinal
50422 BASTARD And hang a calf'sskin on his recreant limbs
50423 AUSTRIA Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs
50424 Because
50425 BASTARD Your breeches best may carry them
50426 KING JOHN Philip what say'st thou to the Cardinal
50427 CONSTANCE What should he say but as the Cardinal
50428 LEWIS Bethink you father for the difference
50429 Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
50430 Or the light loss of England for a friend
50431 Forgo the easier
50432 BLANCH That's the curse of Rome
50433 CONSTANCE O Lewis stand fast The devil tempts thee here
50434 In likeness of a new untrimmed bride
50435 BLANCH The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
50436 But from her need
50437 CONSTANCE O if thou grant my need
50438 Which only lives but by the death of faith
50439 That need must needs infer this principle
50440 That faith would live again by death of need
50441 O then tread down my need and faith mounts up
50442 Keep my need up and faith is trodden down
50443 KING JOHN The King is mov'd and answers not to this
50444 CONSTANCE O be remov'd from him and answer well
50445 AUSTRIA Do so King Philip hang no more in doubt
50446 BASTARD Hang nothing but a calf'sskin most sweet lout
50447 KING PHILIP I am perplex'd and know not what to say
50448 PANDULPH What canst thou say but will perplex thee more
50449 If thou stand excommunicate and curs'd
50450 KING PHILIP Good reverend father make my person yours
50451 And tell me how you would bestow yourself
50452 This royal hand and mine are newly knit
50453 And the conjunction of our inward souls
50454 Married in league coupled and link'd together
50455 With all religious strength of sacred vows
50456 The latest breath that gave the sound of words
50457 Was deepsworn faith peace amity true love
50458 Between our kingdoms and our royal selves
50459 And even before this truce but new before
50460 No longer than we well could wash our hands
50461 To clap this royal bargain up of peace
50462 Heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd
50463 With slaughter's pencil where revenge did paint
50464 The fearful difference of incensed kings
50465 And shall these hands so lately purg'd of blood
50466 So newly join'd in love so strong in both
50467 Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
50468 Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
50469 Make such unconstant children of ourselves
50470 As now again to snatch our palm from palm
50471 Unswear faith sworn and on the marriagebed
50472 Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
50473 And make a riot on the gentle brow
50474 Of true sincerity O holy sir
50475 My reverend father let it not be so
50476 Out of your grace devise ordain impose
50477 Some gentle order and then we shall be blest
50478 To do your pleasure and continue friends
50479 PANDULPH All form is formless order orderless
50480 Save what is opposite to England's love
50481 Therefore to arms be champion of our church
50482 Or let the church our mother breathe her curse
50483 A mother's curseon her revolting son
50484 France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
50485 A chafed lion by the mortal paw
50486 A fasting tiger safer by the tooth
50487 Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
50488 KING PHILIP I may disjoin my hand but not my faith
50489 PANDULPH So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith
50490 And like a civil war set'st oath to oath
50491 Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow
50492 First made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd
50493 That is to be the champion of our Church
50494 What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself
50495 And may not be performed by thyself
50496 For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
50497 Is not amiss when it is truly done
50498 And being not done where doing tends to ill
50499 The truth is then most done not doing it
50500 The better act of purposes mistook
50501 Is to mistake again though indirect
50502 Yet indirection thereby grows direct
50503 And falsehood cures as fire cools fire
50504 Within the scorched veins of one newburn'd
50505 It is religion that doth make vows kept
50506 But thou hast sworn against religion
50507 By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st
50508 And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth
50509 Against an oath the truth thou art unsure
50510 To swear swears only not to be forsworn
50511 Else what a mockery should it be to swear
50512 But thou dost swear only to be forsworn
50513 And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
50514 Therefore thy later vows against thy first
50515 Is in thyself rebellion to thyself
50516 And better conquest never canst thou make
50517 Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
50518 Against these giddy loose suggestions
50519 Upon which better part our pray'rs come in
50520 If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know
50521 The peril of our curses fight on thee
50522 So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
50523 But in despair die under the black weight
50524 AUSTRIA Rebellion flat rebellion

50547 When such profound respects do pull you on
50548 PANDULPH I will denounce a curse upon his head
50549 KING PHILIP Thou shalt not need England I will fall from thee
50550 CONSTANCE O fair return of banish'd majesty
50551 ELINOR O foul revolt of French inconstancy

50634 I had a thing to saybut let it go
50635 The sun is in the heaven and the proud day
50636 Attended with the pleasures of the world
50637 Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
50638 To give me audience If the midnight bell
50639 Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
50640 Sound on into the drowsy race of night
50641 If this same were a churchyard where we stand
50642 And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs

50692 And bloody England into England gone
50693 O'erbearing interruption spite of France
50694 LEWIS he hath won that hath he fortified
50695 So hot a speed with such advice dispos'd
50696 Such temperate order in so fierce a cause
50697 Doth want example who hath read or heard
50698 Of any kindred action like to this

50712 Arise forth from the couch of lasting night
50713 Thou hate and terror to prosperity
50714 And I will kiss thy detestable bones
50715 And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
50716 And ring these fingers with thy household worms
50717 And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
50718 And be a carrion monster like thyself
50719 Come grin on me and I will think thou smil'st
50720 And buss thee as thy wife Misery's love
50721 O come to me
50722 KING PHILIP O fair affliction peace
50723 CONSTANCE No no I will not having breath to cry
50724 O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth
50725 Then with a passion would I shake the world
50726 And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
50727 Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
50728 Which scorns a modern invocation
50729 PANDULPH Lady you utter madness and not sorrow
50730 CONSTANCE Thou art not holy to belie me so
50731 I am not mad this hair I tear is mine
50732 My name is Constance I was Geffrey's wife
50733 Young Arthur is my son and he is lost
50734 I am not madI would to heaven I were
50735 For then 'tis like I should forget myself
50736 O if I could what grief should I forget
50737 Preach some philosophy to make me mad
50738 And thou shalt be canoniz'd Cardinal
50739 For being not mad but sensible of grief
50740 My reasonable part produces reason
50741 How I may be deliver'd of these woes
50742 And teaches me to kill or hang myself
50743 If I were mad I should forget my son
50744 Or madly think a babe of clouts were he
50745 I am not mad too well too well I feel
50746 The different plague of each calamity
50747 KING PHILIP Bind up those tresses O what love I note
50748 In the fair multitude of those her hairs
50749 Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall'n
50750 Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
50751 Do glue themselves in sociable grief
50752 Like true inseparable faithful loves
50753 Sticking together in calamity
50754 CONSTANCE To England if you will
50755 KING PHILIP Bind up your hairs
50756 CONSTANCE Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it
50757 I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
50758 'O that these hands could so redeem my son
50759 As they have given these hairs their liberty'
50760 But now I envy at their liberty
50761 And will again commit them to their bonds
50762 Because my poor child is a prisoner
50763 And father Cardinal I have heard you say
50764 That we shall see and know our friends in heaven
50765 If that be true I shall see my boy again
50766 For since the birth of Cain the first male child
50767 To him that did but yesterday suspire
50768 There was not such a gracious creature born
50769 But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
50770 And chase the native beauty from his cheek
50771 And he will look as hollow as a ghost
50772 As dim and meagre as an ague's fit
50773 And so he'll die and rising so again
50774 When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
50775 I shall not know him Therefore never never
50776 Must I behold my pretty Arthur more
50777 PANDULPH You hold too heinous a respect of grief
50778 CONSTANCE He talks to me that never had a son
50779 KING PHILIP You are as fond of grief as of your child
50780 CONSTANCE Grief fills the room up of my absent child
50781 Lies in his bed walks up and down with me
50782 Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
50783 Remembers me of all his gracious parts
50784 Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
50785 Then have I reason to be fond of grief
50786 Fare you well had you such a loss as I
50787 I could give better comfort than you do
50788 I will not keep this form upon my head
50789 [Tearing her hair]
50790 When there is such disorder in my wit
50791 O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son
50792 My life my joy my food my ail the world
50793 My widowcomfort and my sorrows cure Exit
50794 KING PHILIP I fear some outrage and I'll follow her Exit
50795 LEWIS There's nothing in this world can make me joy
50796 Life is as tedious as a twicetold tale
50797 Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
50798 And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
50799 That it yields nought but shame and bitterness
50800 PANDULPH Before the curing of a strong disease
50801 Even in the instant of repair and health
50802 The fit is strongest evils that take leave
50803 On their departure most of all show evil
50804 What have you lost by losing of this day
50805 LEWIS All days of glory joy and happiness
50806 PANDULPH If you had won it certainly you had
50807 No no when Fortune means to men most good
50808 She looks upon them with a threat'ning eye
50809 'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
50810 In this which he accounts so clearly won
50811 Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner
50812 LEWIS As heartily as he is glad he hath him
50813 PANDULPH Your mind is all as youthful as your blood
50814 Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
50815 For even the breath of what I mean to speak
50816 Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
50817 Out of the path which shall directly lead
50818 Thy foot to England's throne And therefore mark
50819 John hath seiz'd Arthur and it cannot be
50820 That whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins
50821 The misplac'd John should entertain an hour
50822 One minute nay one quiet breath of rest
50823 A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
50824 Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd
50825 And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place
50826 Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
50827 That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall
50828 So be it for it cannot be but so
50829 LEWIS But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall
50830 PANDULPH You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife
50831 May then make all the claim that Arthur did
50832 LEWIS And lose it life and all as Arthur did
50833 PANDULPH How green you are and fresh in this old world
50834 John lays you plots the times conspire with you
50835 For he that steeps his safety in true blood
50836 Shall find but bloody safety and untrue
50837 This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
50838 Of all his people and freeze up their zeal
50839 That none so small advantage shall step forth
50840 To check his reign but they will cherish it
50841 No natural exhalation in the sky
50842 No scope of nature no distemper'd day
50843 No common wind no customed event
50844 But they will pluck away his natural cause
50845 And call them meteors prodigies and signs
50846 Abortives presages and tongues of heaven
50847 Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John
50848 LEWIS May be he will not touch young Arthur's life
50849 But hold himself safe in his prisonment
50850 PANDULPH O Sir when he shall hear of your approach
50851 If that young Arthur be not gone already
50852 Even at that news he dies and then the hearts
50853 Of all his people shall revolt from him
50854 And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
50855 And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
50856 Out of the bloody fingers ends of john
50857 Methinks I see this hurly all on foot
50858 And O what better matter breeds for you
50859 Than I have nam'd The bastard Faulconbridge
50860 Is now in England ransacking the Church
50861 Offending charity if but a dozen French
50862 Were there in arms they would be as a can
50863 To train ten thousand English to their side
50864 Or as a little snow tumbled about
50865 Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin
50866 Go with me to the King 'Tis wonderful
50867 What may be wrought out of their discontent
50868 Now that their souls are topful of offence
50869 For England go I will whet on the King
50870 LEWIS Strong reasons makes strong actions Let us go
50871 If you say ay the King will not say no Exeunt

50881 England A castle
50882 Enter HUBERT and EXECUTIONERS
50883 HUBERT Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
50884 Within the arras When I strike my foot
50885 Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
50886 And bind the boy which you shall find with me
50887 Fast to the chair Be heedful hence and watch
50888 EXECUTIONER I hope your warrant will bear out the deed
50889 HUBERT Uncleanly scruples Fear not you Look to't
50890 Exeunt EXECUTIONERS
50891 Young lad come forth I have to say with you
50892 Enter ARTHUR
50893 ARTHUR Good morrow Hubert
50894 HUBERT Good morrow little Prince
50895 ARTHUR As little prince having so great a tide
50896 To be more prince as may be You are sad
50897 HUBERT Indeed I have been merrier
50898 ARTHUR Mercy on me
50899 Methinks no body should be sad but I
50900 Yet I remember when I was in France
50901 Young gentlemen would be as sad as night
50902 Only for wantonness By my christendom
50903 So I were out of prison and kept sheep
50904 I should be as merry as the day is long
50905 And so I would be here but that I doubt
50906 My uncle practises more harm to me
50907 He is afraid of me and I of him
50908 Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son
50909 No indeed ist not and I would to heaven
50910 I were your son so you would love me Hubert
50911 HUBERT [Aside] If I talk to him with his innocent prate
50912 He will awake my mercy which lies dead
50913 Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch
50914 ARTHUR Are you sick Hubert You look pale today
50915 In sooth I would you were a little sick
50916 That I might sit all night and watch with you
50917 I warrant I love you more than you do me
50918 HUBERT [Aside] His words do take possession of my bosom
50919 Read here young Arthur [Showing a paper]
50920 [Aside] How now foolish rheum
50921 Turning dispiteous torture out of door
50922 I must be brief lest resolution drop
50923 Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears
50924 Can you not read it Is it not fair writ
50925 ARTHUR Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect
50926 Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
50927 HUBERT Young boy I must
50928 ARTHUR And will you
50929 HUBERT And I will
50930 ARTHUR Have you the heart When your head did but ache
50931 I knit my handkerchief about your brows
50932 The best I had a princess wrought it me
50933 And I did never ask it you again
50934 And with my hand at midnight held your head
50935 And like the watchful minutes to the hour
50936 Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time
50937 Saying 'What lack you and 'Where lies your grief'
50938 Or 'What good love may I perform for you'
50939 Many a poor man's son would have lyen still
50940 And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you
50941 But you at your sick service had a prince
50942 Nay you may think my love was crafty love
50943 And call it cunning Do an if you will
50944 If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill
50945 Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes
50946 These eyes that never did nor never shall
50947 So much as frown on you
50948 HUBERT I have sworn to do it
50949 And with hot irons must I burn them out
50950 ARTHUR Ah none but in this iron age would do it
50951 The iron of itself though heat redhot
50952 Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
50953 And quench his fiery indignation
50954 Even in the matter of mine innocence
50955 Nay after that consume away in rust
50956 But for containing fire to harm mine eye
50957 Are you more stubbornhard than hammer'd iron
50958 An if an angel should have come to me
50959 And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
50960 I would not have believ'd himno tongue but Hubert's
50961 HUBERT [Stamps] Come forth
50962 Reenter EXECUTIONERS With cord irons etc
50963 Do as I bid you do
50964 ARTHUR O save me Hubert save me My eyes are out
50965 Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
50966 HUBERT Give me the iron I say and bind him here
50967 ARTHUR Alas what need you be so boist'rous rough
50968 I will not struggle I will stand stonestill
50969 For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound
50970 Nay hear me Hubert Drive these men away
50971 And I will sit as quiet as a lamb
50972 I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
50973 Nor look upon the iron angrily
50974 Thrust but these men away and I'll forgive you
50975 Whatever torment you do put me to
50976 HUBERT Go stand within let me alone with him
50977 EXECUTIONER I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed
50978 Exeunt EXECUTIONERS
50979 ARTHUR Alas I then have chid away my friend
50980 He hath a stern look but a gentle heart
50981 Let him come back that his compassion may
50982 Give life to yours
50983 HUBERT Come boy prepare yourself
50984 ARTHUR Is there no remedy
50985 HUBERT None but to lose your eyes
50986 ARTHUR O heaven that there were but a mote in yours
50987 A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
50988 Any annoyance in that precious sense
50989 Then feeling what small things are boisterous there
50990 Your vile intent must needs seem horrible
50991 HUBERT Is this your promise Go to hold your tongue
50992 ARTHUR Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
50993 Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
50994 Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert
50995 Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue
50996 So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes
50997 Though to no use but still to look on you
50998 Lo by my troth the instrument is cold
50999 And would not harm me
51000 HUBERT I can heat it boy
51001 ARTHUR No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
51002 Being create for comfort to be us'd
51003 In undeserved extremes See else yourself
51004 There is no malice in this burning coal
51005 The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
51006 And strew'd repentant ashes on his head
51007 HUBERT But with my breath I can revive it boy
51008 ARTHUR An if you do you will but make it blush
51009 And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert
51010 Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
51011 And like a dog that is compell'd to fight
51012 Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
51013 All things that you should use to do me wrong
51014 Deny their office only you do lack
51015 That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
51016 Creatures of note for mercylacking uses
51017 HUBERT Well see to live I will not touch thine eye
51018 For all the treasure that thine uncle owes
51019 Yet I am sworn and I did purpose boy
51020 With this same very iron to burn them out
51021 ARTHUR O now you look like Hubert All this while
51022 You were disguis'd
51023 HUBERT Peace no more Adieu
51024 Your uncle must not know but you are dead
51025 I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports
51026 And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
51027 That Hubert for the wealth of all the world
51028 Will not offend thee
51029 ARTHUR O heaven I thank you Hubert
51030 HUBERT Silence no more Go closely in with me
51031 Much danger do I undergo for thee Exeunt
51032 SCENE 2
51033 England KING JOHN'S palace
51034 Enter KING JOHN PEMBROKE SALISBURY and other LORDS
51035 KING JOHN Here once again we sit once again crown'd
51036 And look'd upon I hope with cheerful eyes
51037 PEMBROKE This once again but that your Highness pleas'd
51038 Was once superfluous you were crown'd before
51039 And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off
51040 The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt
51041 Fresh expectation troubled not the land
51042 With any long'dfor change or better state
51043 SALISBURY Therefore to be possess'd with double pomp
51044 To guard a title that was rich before
51045 To gild refined gold to paint the lily
51046 To throw a perfume on the violet
51047 To smooth the ice or add another hue
51048 Unto the rainbow or with taperlight
51049 To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
51050 Is wasteful and ridiculous excess
51051 PEMBROKE But that your royal pleasure must be done
51052 This act is as an ancient tale new told
51053 And in the last repeating troublesome
51054 Being urged at a time unseasonable
51055 SALISBURY In this the antique and wellnoted face
51056 Of plain old form is much disfigured
51057 And like a shifted wind unto a sail
51058 It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
51059 Startles and frights consideration
51060 Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
51061 For putting on so new a fashion'd robe
51062 PEMBROKE When workmen strive to do better than well
51063 They do confound their skill in covetousness
51064 And oftentimes excusing of a fault
51065 Doth make the fault the worse by th excuse
51066 As patches set upon a little breach
51067 Discredit more in hiding of the fault
51068 Than did the fault before it was so patch'd
51069 SALISBURY To this effect before you were newcrown'd
51070 We breath'd our counsel but it pleas'd your Highness
51071 To overbear it and we are all well pleas'd
51072 Since all and every part of what we would
51073 Doth make a stand at what your Highness will
51074 KING JOHN Some reasons of this double coronation
51075 I have possess'd you with and think them strong
51076 And more more strong when lesser is my fear
51077 I shall indue you with Meantime but ask
51078 What you would have reform'd that is not well
51079 And well shall you perceive how willingly
51080 I will both hear and grant you your requests
51081 PEMBROKE Then I as one that am the tongue of these
51082 To sound the purposes of all their hearts
51083 Both for myself and them but chief of all
51084 Your safety for the which myself and them
51085 Bend their best studies heartily request
51086 Th enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint
51087 Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
51088 To break into this dangerous argument
51089 If what in rest you have in right you hold
51090 Why then your fearswhich as they say attend
51091 The steps of wrongshould move you to mew up
51092 Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
51093 With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
51094 The rich advantage of good exercise
51095 That the time's enemies may not have this
51096 To grace occasions let it be our suit
51097 That you have bid us ask his liberty
51098 Which for our goods we do no further ask
51099 Than whereupon our weal on you depending
51100 Counts it your weal he have his liberty
51101 KING JOHN Let it be so I do commit his youth
51102 To your direction
51103 Enter HUBERT
51104 [Aside] Hubert what news with you
51105 PEMBROKE This is the man should do the bloody deed
51106 He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine
51107 The image of a wicked heinous fault
51108 Lives in his eye that close aspect of his
51109 Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast
51110 And I do fearfully believe 'tis done
51111 What we so fear'd he had a charge to do
51112 SALISBURY The colour of the King doth come and go
51113 Between his purpose and his conscience
51114 Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set
51115 His passion is so ripe it needs must break
51116 PEMBROKE And when it breaks I fear will issue thence
51117 The foul corruption of a sweet child's death
51118 KING JOHN We cannot hold mortality's strong hand
51119 Good lords although my will to give is living
51120 The suit which you demand is gone and dead
51121 He tells us Arthur is deceas'd tonight
51122 SALISBURY Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure
51123 PEMBROKE Indeed we heard how near his death he was
51124 Before the child himself felt he was sick
51125 This must be answer'd either here or hence
51126 KING JOHN Why do you bend such solemn brows on me
51127 Think you I bear the shears of destiny
51128 Have I commandment on the pulse of life
51129 SALISBURY It is apparent foulplay and 'tis shame
51130 That greatness should so grossly offer it
51131 So thrive it in your game and so farewell
51132 PEMBROKE Stay yet Lord Salisbury I'll go with thee
51133 And find th inheritance of this poor child
51134 His little kingdom of a forced grave
51135 That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle
51136 Three foot of it doth holdbad world the while
51137 This must not be thus borne this will break out
51138 To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt Exeunt LORDS
51139 KING JOHN They burn in indignation I repent
51140 There is no sure foundation set on blood
51141 No certain life achiev'd by others death
51142 Enter a MESSENGER
51143 A fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
51144 That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks
51145 So foul a sky clears not without a storm
51146 Pour down thy weatherhow goes all in France
51147 MESSENGER From France to England Never such a pow'r
51148 For any foreign preparation
51149 Was levied in the body of a land
51150 The copy of your speed is learn'd by them
51151 For when you should be told they do prepare
51152 The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd
51153 KING JOHN O where hath our intelligence been drunk
51154 Where hath it slept Where is my mother's care
51155 That such an army could be drawn in France
51156 And she not hear of it
51157 MESSENGER My liege her ear
51158 Is stopp'd with dust the first of April died
51159 Your noble mother and as I hear my lord
51160 The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
51161 Three days before but this from rumour's tongue
51162 I idly heardif true or false I know not
51163 KING JOHN Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
51164 O make a league with me till I have pleas'd
51165 My discontented peers What mother dead
51166 How wildly then walks my estate in France
51167 Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France
51168 That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here
51169 MESSENGER Under the Dauphin
51170 KING JOHN Thou hast made me giddy
51171 With these in tidings
51172 Enter the BASTARD and PETER OF POMFRET
51173 Now What says the world
51174 To your proceedings Do not seek to stuff
51175 My head with more ill news for it is fun
51176 BASTARD But if you be afear'd to hear the worst
51177 Then let the worst unheard fall on your head
51178 KING JOHN Bear with me cousin for I was amaz'd
51179 Under the tide but now I breathe again
51180 Aloft the flood and can give audience
51181 To any tongue speak it of what it will
51182 BASTARD How I have sped among the clergymen
51183 The sums I have collected shall express
51184 But as I travell'd hither through the land
51185 I find the people strangely fantasied
51186 Possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams
51187 Not knowing what they fear but full of fear
51188 And here's a prophet that I brought with me
51189 From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found
51190 With many hundreds treading on his heels
51191 To whom he sung in rude harshsounding rhymes
51192 That ere the next Ascensionday at noon
51193 Your Highness should deliver up your crown
51194 KING JOHN Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
51195 PETER Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
51196 KING JOHN Hubert away with him imprison him
51197 And on that day at noon whereon he says
51198 I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd
51199 Deliver him to safety and return
51200 For I must use thee
51201 Exit HUBERT with PETER
51202 O my gentle cousin
51203 Hear'st thou the news abroad who are arriv'd
51204 BASTARD The French my lord men's mouths are full of it
51205 Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
51206 With eyes as red as newenkindled fire
51207 And others more going to seek the grave
51208 Of Arthur whom they say is kill'd tonight
51209 On your suggestion
51210 KING JOHN Gentle kinsman go
51211 And thrust thyself into their companies
51212 I have a way to will their loves again
51213 Bring them before me
51214 BASTARD I Will seek them out
51215 KING JOHN Nay but make haste the better foot before
51216 O let me have no subject enemies
51217 When adverse foreigners affright my towns
51218 With dreadful pomp of stout invasion
51219 Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels
51220 And fly like thought from them to me again
51221 BASTARD The spirit of the time shall teach me speed
51222 KING JOHN Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
51223 Exit BASTARD
51224 Go after him for he perhaps shall need
51225 Some messenger betwixt me and the peers
51226 And be thou he
51227 MESSENGER With all my heart my liege Exit
51228 KING JOHN My mother dead
51229 Reenter HUBERT
51230 HUBERT My lord they say five moons were seen tonight
51231 Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
51232 The other four in wondrous motion
51233 KING JOHN Five moons
51234 HUBERT Old men and beldams in the streets
51235 Do prophesy upon it dangerously
51236 Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths
51237 And when they talk of him they shake their heads
51238 And whisper one another in the ear
51239 And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
51240 Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
51241 With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
51242 I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
51243 The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
51244 With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news
51245 Who with his shears and measure in his hand
51246 Standing on slippers which his nimble haste
51247 Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
51248 Told of a many thousand warlike French
51249 That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent
51250 Another lean unwash'd artificer
51251 Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death
51252 KING JOHN Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears
51253 Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death
51254 Thy hand hath murd'red him I had a mighty cause
51255 To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
51256 HUBERT No had my lord Why did you not provoke me
51257 KING JOHN It is the curse of kings to be attended
51258 By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
51259 To break within the bloody house of life
51260 And on the winking of authority
51261 To understand a law to know the meaning
51262 Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
51263 More upon humour than advis'd respect
51264 HUBERT Here is your hand and seal for what I did
51265 KING JOHN O when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
51266 Is to be made then shall this hand and seal
51267 Witness against us to damnation
51268 How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
51269 Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by
51270 A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd
51271 Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame
51272 This murder had not come into my mind
51273 But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
51274 Finding thee fit for bloody villainy
51275 Apt liable to be employ'd in danger
51276 I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death
51277 And thou to be endeared to a king
51278 Made it no conscience to destroy a prince
51279 HUBERT My lord
51280 KING JOHN Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
51281 When I spake darkly what I purposed
51282 Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face
51283 As bid me tell my tale in express words
51284 Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
51285 And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
51286 But thou didst understand me by my signs
51287 And didst in signs again parley with sin
51288 Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
51289 And consequently thy rude hand to act
51290 The deed which both our tongues held vile to name
51291 Out of my sight and never see me more
51292 My nobles leave me and my state is braved
51293 Even at my gates with ranks of foreign pow'rs
51294 Nay in the body of the fleshly land
51295 This kingdom this confine of blood and breath
51296 Hostility and civil tumult reigns
51297 Between my conscience and my cousin's death
51298 HUBERT Arm you against your other enemies
51299 I'll make a peace between your soul and you
51300 Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine
51301 Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
51302 Not painted with the crimson spots of blood
51303 Within this bosom never ent'red yet
51304 The dreadful motion of a murderous thought
51305 And you have slander'd nature in my form
51306 Which howsoever rude exteriorly
51307 Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
51308 Than to be butcher of an innocent child
51309 KING JOHN Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers

51311 And make them tame to their obedience
51312 Forgive the comment that my passion made
51313 Upon thy feature for my rage was blind
51314 And foul imaginary eyes of blood
51315 Presented thee more hideous than thou art
51316 O answer not but to my closet bring
51317 The angry lords with all expedient haste
51318 I conjure thee but slowly run more fast Exeunt

51320 England Before the castle

51322 ARTHUR The wall is high and yet will I leap down
51323 Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
51324 There's few or none do know me if they did
51325 This shipboy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite
51326 I am afraid and yet I'll venture it
51327 If I get down and do not break my limbs
51328 I'll find a thousand shifts to get away
51329 As good to die and go as die and stay [Leaps down]
51330 O me my uncle's spirit is in these stones
51331 Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones

51346 The King by me requests your presence straight
51347 SALISBURY The King hath dispossess'd himself of us
51348 We will not line his thin bestained cloak
51349 With our pure honours nor attend the foot
51350 That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks
51351 Return and tell him so We know the worst
51352 BASTARD Whate'er you think good words I think were best
51353 SALISBURY Our griefs and not our manners reason now

51360 The earth had not a hole to hide this deed
51361 SALISBURY Murder as hating what himself hath done
51362 Doth lay it open to urge on revenge
51363 BIGOT Or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave
51364 Found it too preciousprincely for a grave
51365 SALISBURY Sir Richard what think you Have you beheld
51366 Or have you read or heard or could you think
51367 Or do you almost think although you see
51368 That you do see Could thought without this object
51369 Form such another This is the very top
51370 The height the crest or crest unto the crest
51371 Of murder's arms this is the bloodiest shame
51372 The wildest savagery the vilest stroke
51373 That ever walley'd wrath or staring rage
51374 Presented to the tears of soft remorse
51375 PEMBROKE All murders past do stand excus'd in this
51376 And this so sole and so unmatchable
51377 Shall give a holiness a purity
51378 To the yet unbegotten sin of times
51379 And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
51380 Exampled by this heinous spectacle
51381 BASTARD It is a damned and a bloody work
51382 The graceless action of a heavy hand
51383 If that it be the work of any hand
51384 SALISBURY If that it be the work of any hand
51385 We had a kind of light what would ensue
51386 It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand
51387 The practice and the purpose of the King
51388 From whose obedience I forbid my soul
51389 Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
51390 And breathing to his breathless excellence
51391 The incense of a vow a holy vow
51392 Never to taste the pleasures of the world
51393 Never to be infected with delight
51394 Nor conversant with ease and idleness
51395 Till I have set a glory to this hand

51407 HUBERT Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say
51408 By heaven I think my sword's as sharp as yours
51409 I would not have you lord forget yourself
51410 Nor tempt the danger of my true defence
51411 Lest I by marking of your rage forget
51412 Your worth your greatness and nobility
51413 BIGOT Out dunghill Dar'st thou brave a nobleman
51414 HUBERT Not for my life but yet I dare defend
51415 My innocent life against an emperor
51416 SALISBURY Thou art a murderer

51422 SALISBURY Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge
51423 BASTARD Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury
51424 If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
51425 Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
51426 I'll strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime
51427 Or I'll so maul you and your toastingiron
51428 That you shall think the devil is come from hell
51429 BIGOT What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge
51430 Second a villain and a murderer
51431 HUBERT Lord Bigot I am none
51432 BIGOT Who kill'd this prince
51433 HUBERT 'Tis not an hour since I left him well
51434 I honour'd him I lov'd him and will weep
51435 My date of life out for his sweet life's loss
51436 SALISBURY Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
51437 For villainy is not without such rheum
51438 And he long traded in it makes it seem
51439 Like rivers of remorse and innocency
51440 Away with me all you whose souls abhor
51441 Th uncleanly savours of a slaughterhouse
51442 For I am stifled with this smell of sin
51443 BIGOT Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there
51444 PEMBROKE There tell the King he may inquire us out
51445 Exeunt LORDS
51446 BASTARD Here's a good world Knew you of this fair work
51447 Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
51448 Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
51449 Art thou damn'd Hubert
51450 HUBERT Do but hear me sir
51451 BASTARD Ha I'll tell thee what
51452 Thou'rt damn'd as blacknay nothing is so black
51453 Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer
51454 There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
51455 As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
51456 HUBERT Upon my soul
51457 BASTARD If thou didst but consent
51458 To this most cruel act do but despair
51459 And if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread
51460 That ever spider twisted from her womb
51461 Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
51462 To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
51463 Put but a little water in a spoon
51464 And it shall be as all the ocean
51465 Enough to stifle such a villain up
51466 I do suspect thee very grievously
51467 HUBERT If I in act consent or sin of thought
51468 Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
51469 Which was embounded in this beauteous clay
51470 Let hell want pains enough to torture me
51471 I left him well
51472 BASTARD Go bear him in thine arms
51473 I am amaz'd methinks and lose my way
51474 Among the thorns and dangers of this world
51475 How easy dost thou take all England up
51476 From forth this morsel of dead royalty
51477 The life the right and truth of all this realm
51478 Is fled to heaven and England now is left
51479 To tug and scamble and to part by th teeth
51480 The unowed interest of proudswelling state
51481 Now for the barepick'd bone of majesty
51482 Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
51483 And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
51484 Now powers from home and discontents at home
51485 Meet in one line and vast confusion waits
51486 As doth a raven on a sickfall'n beast
51487 The imminent decay of wrested pomp
51488 Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
51489 Hold out this tempest Bear away that child
51490 And follow me with speed I'll to the King
51491 A thousand businesses are brief in hand
51492 And heaven itself doth frown upon the land Exeunt

51504 KING JOHN Thus have I yielded up into your hand
51505 The circle of my glory
51506 PANDULPH [Gives back the crown] Take again
51507 From this my hand as holding of the Pope
51508 Your sovereign greatness and authority
51509 KING JOHN Now keep your holy word go meet the French
51510 And from his Holiness use all your power
51511 To stop their marches fore we are inflam'd
51512 Our discontented counties do revolt
51513 Our people quarrel with obedience
51514 Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
51515 To stranger blood to foreign royalty
51516 This inundation of mistemp'red humour
51517 Rests by you only to be qualified
51518 Then pause not for the present time's so sick
51519 That present med'cine must be minist'red
51520 Or overthrow incurable ensues
51521 PANDULPH It was my breath that blew this tempest up
51522 Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope
51523 But since you are a gentle convertite
51524 My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
51525 And make fair weather in your blust'ring land
51526 On this Ascensionday remember well
51527 Upon your oath of service to the Pope
51528 Go I to make the French lay down their arms Exit
51529 KING JOHN Is this Ascensionday Did not the prophet
51530 Say that before Ascensionday at noon
51531 My crown I should give off Even so I have
51532 I did suppose it should be on constraint
51533 But heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary
51534 Enter the BASTARD
51535 BASTARD All Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
51536 But Dover Castle London hath receiv'd
51537 Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers
51538 Your nobles will not hear you but are gone
51539 To offer service to your enemy
51540 And wild amazement hurries up and down
51541 The little number of your doubtful friends
51542 KING JOHN Would not my lords return to me again
51543 After they heard young Arthur was alive
51544 BASTARD They found him dead and cast into the streets
51545 An empty casket where the jewel of life
51546 By some damn'd hand was robbed and ta'en away
51547 KING JOHN That villain Hubert told me he did live
51548 BASTARD So on my soul he did for aught he knew
51549 But wherefore do you droop Why look you sad
51550 Be great in act as you have been in thought
51551 Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
51552 Govern the motion of a kingly eye
51553 Be stirring as the time be fire with fire
51554 Threaten the threat'ner and outface the brow
51555 Of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
51556 That borrow their behaviours from the great
51557 Grow great by your example and put on
51558 The dauntless spirit of resolution
51559 Away and glister like the god of war
51560 When he intendeth to become the field
51561 Show boldness and aspiring confidence
51562 What shall they seek the lion in his den
51563 And fright him there and make him tremble there
51564 O let it not be said Forage and run
51565 To meet displeasure farther from the doors
51566 And grapple with him ere he come so nigh
51567 KING JOHN The legate of the Pope hath been with me
51568 And I have made a happy peace with him
51569 And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
51570 Led by the Dauphin
51571 BASTARD O inglorious league
51572 Shall we upon the footing of our land
51573 Send fairplay orders and make compromise
51574 Insinuation parley and base truce
51575 To arms invasive Shall a beardless boy
51576 A cock'red silken wanton brave our fields
51577 And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
51578 Mocking the air with colours idly spread
51579 And find no check Let us my liege to arms
51580 Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace
51581 Or if he do let it at least be said
51582 They saw we had a purpose of defence
51583 KING JOHN Have thou the ordering of this present time
51584 BASTARD Away then with good courage
51585 Yet I know

51589 Enter in arms LEWIS SALISBURY MELUN PEMBROKE BIGOT and soldiers
51590 LEWIS My Lord Melun let this be copied out
51591 And keep it safe for our remembrance
51592 Return the precedent to these lords again
51593 That having our fair order written down
51594 Both they and we perusing o'er these notes
51595 May know wherefore we took the sacrament
51596 And keep our faiths firm and inviolable
51597 SALISBURY Upon our sides it never shall be broken
51598 And noble Dauphin albeit we swear
51599 A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
51600 To your proceedings yet believe me Prince
51601 I am not glad that such a sore of time
51602 Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt
51603 And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
51604 By making many O it grieves my soul
51605 That I must draw this metal from my side
51606 To be a widowmaker O and there
51607 Where honourable rescue and defence
51608 Cries out upon the name of Salisbury
51609 But such is the infection of the time
51610 That for the health and physic of our right
51611 We cannot deal but with the very hand
51612 Of stern injustice and confused wrong
51613 And is't not pity O my grieved friends
51614 That we the sons and children of this isle
51615 Were born to see so sad an hour as this
51616 Wherein we step after a strangermarch
51617 Upon her gentle bosom and fill up
51618 Her enemies ranksI must withdraw and weep
51619 Upon the spot of this enforced cause
51620 To grace the gentry of a land remote
51621 And follow unacquainted colours here
51622 What here O nation that thou couldst remove
51623 That Neptune's arms who clippeth thee about
51624 Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
51625 And grapple thee unto a pagan shore
51626 Where these two Christian armies might combine
51627 The blood of malice in a vein of league
51628 And not to spend it so unneighbourly
51629 LEWIS A noble temper dost thou show in this
51630 And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
51631 Doth make an earthquake of nobility
51632 O what a noble combat hast thou fought
51633 Between compulsion and a brave respect
51634 Let me wipe off this honourable dew
51635 That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
51636 My heart hath melted at a lady's tears
51637 Being an ordinary inundation
51638 But this effusion of such manly drops
51639 This show'r blown up by tempest of the soul
51640 Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd
51641 Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
51642 Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors
51643 Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury
51644 And with a great heart heave away this storm
51645 Commend these waters to those baby eyes
51646 That never saw the giant world enrag'd
51647 Nor met with fortune other than at feasts
51648 Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
51649 Come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
51650 Into the purse of rich prosperity
51651 As Lewis himself So nobles shall you all
51652 That knit your sinews to the strength of mine
51653 Enter PANDULPH
51654 And even there methinks an angel spake
51655 Look where the holy legate comes apace
51656 To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
51657 And on our actions set the name of right
51658 With holy breath
51659 PANDULPH Hail noble prince of France
51660 The next is this King John hath reconcil'd
51661 Himself to Rome his spirit is come in
51662 That so stood out against the holy Church
51663 The great metropolis and see of Rome
51664 Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up
51665 And tame the savage spirit of wild war
51666 That like a lion fostered up at hand
51667 It may lie gently at the foot of peace
51668 And be no further harmful than in show
51669 LEWIS Your Grace shall pardon me I will not back
51670 I am too highborn to be propertied
51671 To be a secondary at control
51672 Or useful servingman and instrument
51673 To any sovereign state throughout the world
51674 Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
51675 Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself
51676 And brought in matter that should feed this fire
51677 And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
51678 With that same weak wind which enkindled it
51679 You taught me how to know the face of right
51680 Acquainted me with interest to this land
51681 Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
51682 And come ye now to tell me John hath made
51683 His peace with Rome What is that peace to me
51684 I by the honour of my marriagebed
51685 After young Arthur claim this land for mine
51686 And now it is halfconquer'd must I back
51687 Because that John hath made his peace with Rome
51688 Am I Rome's slave What penny hath Rome borne
51689 What men provided what munition sent
51690 To underprop this action Is 't not I
51691 That undergo this charge Who else but I
51692 And such as to my claim are liable
51693 Sweat in this business and maintain this war
51694 Have I not heard these islanders shout out
51695 'Vive le roi as I have bank'd their towns
51696 Have I not here the best cards for the game
51697 To will this easy match play'd for a crown
51698 And shall I now give o'er the yielded set
51699 No no on my soul it never shall be said
51700 PANDULPH You look but on the outside of this work
51701 LEWIS Outside or inside I will not return
51702 Till my attempt so much be glorified
51703 As to my ample hope was promised
51704 Before I drew this gallant head of war
51705 And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
51706 To outlook conquest and to will renown
51707 Even in the jaws of danger and of death
51708 [Trumpet sounds]
51709 What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
51710 Enter the BASTARD attended
51711 BASTARD According to the fair play of the world
51712 Let me have audience I am sent to speak
51713 My holy lord of Milan from the King
51714 I come to learn how you have dealt for him
51715 And as you answer I do know the scope
51716 And warrant limited unto my tongue
51717 PANDULPH The Dauphin is too wilfulopposite
51718 And will not temporize with my entreaties
51719 He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms
51720 BASTARD By all the blood that ever fury breath'd
51721 The youth says well Now hear our English King
51722 For thus his royalty doth speak in me
51723 He is prepar'd and reason too he should
51724 This apish and unmannerly approach
51725 This harness'd masque and unadvised revel
51726 This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops
51727 The King doth smile at and is well prepar'd
51728 To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
51729 From out the circle of his territories
51730 That hand which had the strength even at your door
51731 To cudgel you and make you take the hatch
51732 To dive like buckets in concealed wells
51733 To crouch in litter of your stable planks
51734 To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks
51735 To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
51736 In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
51737 Even at the crying of your nation's crow
51738 Thinking this voice an armed Englishman
51739 Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
51740 That in your chambers gave you chastisement
51741 No Know the gallant monarch is in arms
51742 And like an eagle o'er his aery tow'rs
51743 To souse annoyance that comes near his nest
51744 And you degenerate you ingrate revolts
51745 You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb
51746 Of your dear mother England blush for shame
51747 For your own ladies and palevisag'd maids
51748 Like Amazons come tripping after drums
51749 Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
51750 Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
51751 To fierce and bloody inclination
51752 LEWIS There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
51753 We grant thou canst outscold us Fare thee well
51754 We hold our time too precious to be spent
51755 With such a brabbler
51756 PANDULPH Give me leave to speak
51757 BASTARD No I will speak
51758 LEWIS We will attend to neither
51759 Strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
51760 Plead for our interest and our being here
51761 BASTARD Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
51762 And so shall you being beaten Do but start
51763 And echo with the clamour of thy drum
51764 And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
51765 That shall reverberate all as loud as thine
51766 Sound but another and another shall
51767 As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
51768 And mock the deepmouth'd thunder for at hand
51769 Not trusting to this halting legate here
51770 Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need
51771 Is warlike John and in his forehead sits
51772 A bareribb'd death whose office is this day
51773 To feast upon whole thousands of the French
51774 LEWIS Strike up our drums to find this danger out
51775 BASTARD And thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt

51794 KING JOHN Ay me this tyrant fever burns me up
51795 And will not let me welcome this good news
51796 Set on toward Swinstead to my litter straight
51797 Weakness possesseth me and I am faint Exeunt
51798 SCENE 4
51799 England Another part of the battlefield
51800 Enter SALISBURY PEMBROKE and BIGOT
51801 SALISBURY I did not think the King so stor'd with friends
51802 PEMBROKE Up once again put spirit in the French
51803 If they miscarry we miscarry too
51804 SALISBURY That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge
51805 In spite of spite alone upholds the day
51806 PEMBROKE They say King John sore sick hath left the field
51807 Enter MELUN wounded
51808 MELUN Lead me to the revolts of England here
51809 SALISBURY When we were happy we had other names
51810 PEMBROKE It is the Count Melun
51811 SALISBURY Wounded to death
51812 MELUN Fly noble English you are bought and sold
51813 Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
51814 And welcome home again discarded faith
51815 Seek out King John and fall before his feet
51816 For if the French be lords of this loud day
51817 He means to recompense the pains you take
51818 By cutting off your heads Thus hath he sworn
51819 And I with him and many moe with me
51820 Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury
51821 Even on that altar where we swore to you
51822 Dear amity and everlasting love
51823 SALISBURY May this be possible May this be true
51824 MELUN Have I not hideous death within my view
51825 Retaining but a quantity of life
51826 Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
51827 Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire
51828 What in the world should make me now deceive
51829 Since I must lose the use of all deceit
51830 Why should I then be false since it is true
51831 That I must die here and live hence by truth
51832 I say again if Lewis do will the day
51833 He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours
51834 Behold another day break in the east
51835 But even this night whose black contagious breath
51836 Already smokes about the burning crest
51837 Of the old feeble and daywearied sun
51838 Even this ill night your breathing shall expire
51839 Paying the fine of rated treachery
51840 Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
51841 If Lewis by your assistance win the day
51842 Commend me to one Hubert with your King
51843 The love of himand this respect besides
51844 For that my grandsire was an Englishman
51845 Awakes my conscience to confess all this
51846 In lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence
51847 From forth the noise and rumour of the field
51848 Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
51849 In peace and part this body and my soul
51850 With contemplation and devout desires
51851 SALISBURY We do believe thee and beshrew my soul
51852 But I do love the favour and the form
51853 Of this most fair occasion by the which
51854 We will untread the steps of damned flight
51855 And like a bated and retired flood
51856 Leaving our rankness and irregular course
51857 Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
51858 And calmly run on in obedience
51859 Even to our ocean to great King John
51860 My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
51861 For I do see the cruel pangs of death
51862 Right in thine eye Away my friends New flight
51863 And happy newness that intends old right
51864 Exeunt leading off MELUN
51865 SCENE 5
51866 England The French camp
51867 Enter LEWIS and his train
51868 LEWIS The sun of heaven methought was loath to set
51869 But stay'd and made the western welkin blush
51870 When English measure backward their own ground
51871 In faint retire O bravely came we off
51872 When with a volley of our needless shot
51873 After such bloody toil we bid good night
51874 And wound our tott'ring colours clearly up
51875 Last in the field and almost lords of it
51876 Enter a MESSENGER
51877 MESSENGER Where is my prince the Dauphin
51878 LEWIS Here what news
51879 MESSENGER The Count Melun is slain the English lords
51880 By his persuasion are again fall'n off
51881 And your supply which you have wish'd so long
51882 Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands
51883 LEWIS Ah foul shrewd news Beshrew thy very heart
51884 I did not think to be so sad tonight
51885 As this hath made me Who was he that said
51886 King John did fly an hour or two before
51887 The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs
51888 MESSENGER Whoever spoke it it is true my lord
51889 LEWIS keep good quarter and good care tonight

51899 HUBERT What's that to thee Why may I not demand
51900 Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine

51905 Who art thou
51906 BASTARD Who thou wilt And if thou please
51907 Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
51908 I come one way of the Plantagenets
51909 HUBERT Unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
51910 Have done me shame Brave soldier pardon me
51911 That any accent breaking from thy tongue
51912 Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear
51913 BASTARD Come come sans compliment what news abroad

51915 To find you out
51916 BASTARD Brief then and what's the news
51917 HUBERT O my sweet sir news fitting to the night
51918 Black fearful comfortless and horrible
51919 BASTARD Show me the very wound of this ill news
51920 I am no woman I'll not swoon at it
51921 HUBERT The King I fear is poison'd by a monk
51922 I left him almost speechless and broke out
51923 To acquaint you with this evil that you might
51924 The better arm you to the sudden time
51925 Than if you had at leisure known of this
51926 BASTARD How did he take it who did taste to him
51927 HUBERT A monk I tell you a resolved villain
51928 Whose bowels suddenly burst out The King
51929 Yet speaks and peradventure may recover
51930 BASTARD Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty
51931 HUBERT Why know you not The lords are all come back
51932 And brought Prince Henry in their company
51933 At whose request the King hath pardon'd them

51943 SCENE 7
51944 The orchard at Swinstead Abbey
51945 Enter PRINCE HENRY SALISBURY and BIGOT
51946 PRINCE HENRY It is too late the life of all his blood
51947 Is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain
51948 Which some suppose the soul's frail dwellinghouse
51949 Doth by the idle comments that it makes
51950 Foretell the ending of mortality
51951 Enter PEMBROKE
51952 PEMBROKE His Highness yet doth speak and holds belief
51953 That being brought into the open air
51954 It would allay the burning quality
51955 Of that fell poison which assaileth him
51956 PRINCE HENRY Let him be brought into the orchard here
51957 Doth he still rage Exit BIGOT
51958 PEMBROKE He is more patient
51959 Than when you left him even now he sung
51960 PRINCE HENRY O vanity of sickness Fierce extremes
51961 In their continuance will not feel themselves
51962 Death having prey'd upon the outward parts
51963 Leaves them invisible and his siege is now
51964 Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
51965 With many legions of strange fantasies
51966 Which in their throng and press to that last hold
51967 Confound themselves 'Tis strange that death should sing
51968 I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
51969 Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
51970 And from the organpipe of frailty sings
51971 His soul and body to their lasting rest
51972 SALISBURY Be of good comfort Prince for you are born
51973 To set a form upon that indigest
51974 Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
51975 Reenter BIGOT and attendants who bring in
51976 KING JOHN in a chair
51977 KING JOHN Ay marry now my soul hath elbowroom
51978 It would not out at windows nor at doors
51979 There is so hot a summer in my bosom
51980 That all my bowels crumble up to dust
51981 I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
51982 Upon a parchment and against this fire
51983 Do I shrink up
51984 PRINCE HENRY How fares your Majesty
51985 KING JOHN Poison'dillfare Dead forsook cast off
51986 And none of you will bid the winter come
51987 To thrust his icy fingers in my maw
51988 Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
51989 Through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north
51990 To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
51991 And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much
51992 I beg cold comfort and you are so strait
51993 And so ingrateful you deny me that
51994 PRINCE HENRY O that there were some virtue in my tears
51995 That might relieve you
51996 KING JOHN The salt in them is hot
51997 Within me is a hell and there the poison
51998 Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize
51999 On unreprievable condemned blood
52000 Enter the BASTARD
52001 BASTARD O I am scalded with my violent motion
52002 And spleen of speed to see your Majesty
52003 KING JOHN O cousin thou art come to set mine eye
52004 The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt
52005 And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
52006 Are turned to one thread one little hair
52007 My heart hath one poor string to stay it by
52008 Which holds but till thy news be uttered
52009 And then all this thou seest is but a clod
52010 And module of confounded royalty
52011 BASTARD The Dauphin is preparing hitherward
52012 Where God He knows how we shall answer him
52013 For in a night the best part of my pow'r
52014 As I upon advantage did remove
52015 Were in the Washes all unwarily
52016 Devoured by the unexpected flood [The KING dies]
52017 SALISBURY You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
52018 My liege my lord But now a kingnow thus
52019 PRINCE HENRY Even so must I run on and even so stop
52020 What surety of the world what hope what stay
52021 When this was now a king and now is clay
52022 BASTARD Art thou gone so I do but stay behind
52023 To do the office for thee of revenge
52024 And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
52025 As it on earth hath been thy servant still
52026 Now now you stars that move in your right spheres
52027 Where be your pow'rs Show now your mended faiths
52028 And instantly return with me again
52029 To push destruction and perpetual shame
52030 Out of the weak door of our fainting land
52031 Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
52032 The Dauphin rages at our very heels
52033 SALISBURY It seems you know not then so much as we
52034 The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
52035 Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin
52036 And brings from him such offers of our peace
52037 As we with honour and respect may take
52038 With purpose presently to leave this war
52039 BASTARD He will the rather do it when he sees
52040 Ourselves well sinewed to our defence
52041 SALISBURY Nay 'tis in a manner done already
52042 For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
52043 To the seaside and put his cause and quarrel
52044 To the disposing of the Cardinal
52045 With whom yourself myself and other lords
52046 If you think meet this afternoon will post
52047 To consummate this business happily
52048 BASTARD Let it be so And you my noble Prince
52049 With other princes that may best be spar'd
52050 Shall wait upon your father's funeral
52051 PRINCE HENRY At Worcester must his body be interr'd
52052 For so he will'd it
52053 BASTARD Thither shall it then
52054 And happily may your sweet self put on
52055 The lineal state and glory of the land
52056 To whom with all submission on my knee
52057 I do bequeath my faithful services
52058 And true subjection everlastingly
52059 SALISBURY And the like tender of our love we make
52060 To rest without a spot for evermore
52061 PRINCE HENRY I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
52062 And knows not how to do it but with tears
52063 BASTARD O let us pay the time but needful woe
52064 Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
52065 This England never did nor never shall
52066 Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
52067 But when it first did help to wound itself
52068 Now these her princes are come home again
52069 Come the three corners of the world in arms
52070 And we shall shock them Nought shall make us rue
52071 If England to itself do rest but true Exeunt

52133 Rome A street
52134 Enter Flavius Marullus and certain Commoners
52135 FLAVIUS Hence home you idle creatures get you home
52136 Is this a holiday What know you not
52137 Being mechanical you ought not walk
52138 Upon a laboring day without the sign
52139 Of your profession Speak what trade art thou
52140 FIRST COMMONER Why sir a carpenter
52141 MARULLUS Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
52142 What dost thou with thy best apparel on
52143 You sir what trade are you
52144 SECOND COMMONER Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am
52145 but as you would say a cobbler
52146 MARULLUS But what trade art thou Answer me directly
52147 SECOND COMMONER A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe
52148 conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
52149 MARULLUS What trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what trade
52150 SECOND COMMONER Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet
52151 if you be out sir I can mend you
52152 MARULLUS What mean'st thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellow
52153 SECOND COMMONER Why sir cobble you
52154 FLAVIUS Thou art a cobbler art thou
52155 SECOND COMMONER Truly Sir all that I live by is with the awl I
52156 meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's matters but with
52157 awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in
52158 great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon
52159 neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork
52160 FLAVIUS But wherefore art not in thy shop today
52161 Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
52162 SECOND COMMONER Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
52163 into more work But indeed sir we make holiday to see Caesar
52164 and to rejoice in his triumph
52165 MARULLUS Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
52166 What tributaries follow him to Rome
52167 To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
52168 You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
52169 O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
52170 Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
52171 Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements
52172 To towers and windows yea to chimney tops
52173 Your infants in your arms and there have sat
52174 The livelong day with patient expectation
52175 To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
52176 And when you saw his chariot but appear
52177 Have you not made an universal shout
52178 That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
52179 To hear the replication of your sounds
52180 Made in her concave shores
52181 And do you now put on your best attire
52182 And do you now cull out a holiday
52183 And do you now strew flowers in his way
52184 That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood
52185 Be gone
52186 Run to your houses fall upon your knees
52187 Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
52188 That needs must light on this ingratitude
52189 FLAVIUS Go go good countrymen and for this fault
52190 Assemble all the poor men of your sort
52191 Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
52192 Into the channel till the lowest stream
52193 Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
52194 Exeunt all Commoners
52195 See whether their basest metal be not moved
52196 They vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
52197 Go you down that way towards the Capitol
52198 This way will I Disrobe the images
52199 If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies
52200 MARULLUS May we do so
52201 You know it is the feast of Lupercal
52202 FLAVIUS It is no matter let no images
52203 Be hung with Caesar's trophies I'll about
52204 And drive away the vulgar from the streets
52205 So do you too where you perceive them thick
52206 These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
52207 Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
52208 Who else would soar above the view of men
52209 And keep us all in servile fearfulness Exeunt
52210 SCENE II
52211 A public place
52212 Flourish Enter Caesar Antony for the course Calpurnia Portia
52213 Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and Casca a great crowd follows
52214 among them a Soothsayer
52215 CAESAR Calpurnia
52216 CASCA Peace ho Caesar speaks
52217 Music ceases
52218 CAESAR Calpurnia
52219 CALPURNIA Here my lord
52220 CAESAR Stand you directly in Antonio's way
52221 When he doth run his course Antonio
52222 ANTONY Caesar my lord
52223 CAESAR Forget not in your speed Antonio
52224 To touch Calpurnia for our elders say
52225 The barren touched in this holy chase
52226 Shake off their sterile curse
52227 ANTONY I shall remember
52228 When Caesar says Do this it is perform'd
52229 CAESAR Set on and leave no ceremony out Flourish
52230 SOOTHSAYER Caesar
52231 CAESAR Ha Who calls
52232 CASCA Bid every noise be still Peace yet again
52233 CAESAR Who is it in the press that calls on me
52234 I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
52235 Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turn'd to hear
52236 SOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March
52237 CAESAR What man is that
52238 BRUTUS A soothsayer you beware the ides of March
52239 CAESAR Set him before me let me see his face
52240 CASSIUS Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar
52241 CAESAR What say'st thou to me now Speak once again
52242 SOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March
52243 CAESAR He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass
52244 Sennet Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius
52245 CASSIUS Will you go see the order of the course
52246 BRUTUS Not I
52247 CASSIUS I pray you do
52248 BRUTUS I am not gamesome I do lack some part
52249 Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
52250 Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
52251 I'll leave you
52252 CASSIUS Brutus I do observe you now of late
52253 I have not from your eyes that gentleness
52254 And show of love as I was wont to have
52255 You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
52256 Over your friend that loves you
52257 BRUTUS Cassius
52258 Be not deceived if I have veil'd my look
52259 I turn the trouble of my countenance
52260 Merely upon myself Vexed I am
52261 Of late with passions of some difference
52262 Conceptions only proper to myself
52263 Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
52264 But let not therefore my good friends be grieved
52265 Among which number Cassius be you one
52266 Nor construe any further my neglect
52267 Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
52268 Forgets the shows of love to other men
52269 CASSIUS Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
52270 By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
52271 Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
52272 Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
52273 BRUTUS No Cassius for the eye sees not itself
52274 But by reflection by some other things
52275 CASSIUS 'Tis just
52276 And it is very much lamented Brutus
52277 That you have no such mirrors as will turn
52278 Your hidden worthiness into your eye
52279 That you might see your shadow I have heard
52280 Where many of the best respect in Rome
52281 Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
52282 And groaning underneath this age's yoke
52283 Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes
52284 BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
52285 That you would have me seek into myself
52286 For that which is not in me
52287 CASSIUS Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
52288 And since you know you cannot see yourself
52289 So well as by reflection I your glass
52290 Will modestly discover to yourself
52291 That of yourself which you yet know not of
52292 And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
52293 Were I a common laugher or did use
52294 To stale with ordinary oaths my love
52295 To every new protester if you know
52296 That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
52297 And after scandal them or if you know
52298 That I profess myself in banqueting
52299 To all the rout then hold me dangerous
52300 Flourish and shout
52301 BRUTUS What means this shouting I do fear the people
52302 Choose Caesar for their king
52303 CASSIUS Ay do you fear it
52304 Then must I think you would not have it so
52305 BRUTUS I would not Cassius yet I love him well
52306 But wherefore do you hold me here so long
52307 What is it that you would impart to me
52308 If it be aught toward the general good
52309 Set honor in one eye and death i the other
52310 And I will look on both indifferently
52311 For let the gods so speed me as I love
52312 The name of honor more than I fear death
52313 CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
52314 As well as I do know your outward favor
52315 Well honor is the subject of my story
52316 I cannot tell what you and other men
52317 Think of this life but for my single self
52318 I had as lief not be as live to be
52319 In awe of such a thing as I myself
52320 I was born free as Caesar so were you
52321 We both have fed as well and we can both
52322 Endure the winter's cold as well as he
52323 For once upon a raw and gusty day
52324 The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
52325 Caesar said to me Darest thou Cassius now
52326 Leap in with me into this angry flood
52327 And swim to yonder point Upon the word
52328 Accoutred as I was I plunged in
52329 And bade him follow So indeed he did
52330 The torrent roar'd and we did buffet it
52331 With lusty sinews throwing it aside
52332 And stemming it with hearts of controversy
52333 But ere we could arrive the point proposed
52334 Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink
52335 I as Aeneas our great ancestor
52336 Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
52337 The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
52338 Did I the tired Caesar And this man
52339 Is now become a god and Cassius is
52340 A wretched creature and must bend his body
52341 If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
52342 He had a fever when he was in Spain
52343 And when the fit was on him I did mark
52344 How he did shake 'Tis true this god did shake
52345 His coward lips did from their color fly
52346 And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
52347 Did lose his luster I did hear him groan
52348 Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
52349 Mark him and write his speeches in their books
52350 Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius
52351 As a sick girl Ye gods It doth amaze me
52352 A man of such a feeble temper should
52353 So get the start of the majestic world
52354 And bear the palm alone Shout Flourish
52355 BRUTUS Another general shout
52356 I do believe that these applauses are
52357 For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar
52358 CASSIUS Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
52359 Like a Colossus and we petty men
52360 Walk under his huge legs and peep about
52361 To find ourselves dishonorable graves
52362 Men at some time are masters of their fates
52363 The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
52364 But in ourselves that we are underlings
52365 Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar
52366 Why should that name be sounded more than yours
52367 Write them together yours is as fair a name
52368 Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
52369 Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em
52370 Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
52371 Now in the names of all the gods at once
52372 Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
52373 That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
52374 Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
52375 When went there by an age since the great flood
52376 But it was famed with more than with one man
52377 When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome
52378 That her wide walls encompass'd but one man
52379 Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
52380 When there is in it but one only man
52381 O you and I have heard our fathers say
52382 There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
52383 The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
52384 As easily as a king
52385 BRUTUS That you do love me I am nothing jealous
52386 What you would work me to I have some aim
52387 How I have thought of this and of these times
52388 I shall recount hereafter for this present
52389 I would not so with love I might entreat you
52390 Be any further moved What you have said
52391 I will consider what you have to say
52392 I will with patience hear and find a time
52393 Both meet to hear and answer such high things
52394 Till then my noble friend chew upon this
52395 Brutus had rather be a villager
52396 Than to repute himself a son of Rome
52397 Under these hard conditions as this time
52398 Is like to lay upon us
52399 CASSIUS I am glad that my weak words
52400 Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
52401 Reenter Caesar and his Train
52402 BRUTUS The games are done and Caesar is returning
52403 CASSIUS As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
52404 And he will after his sour fashion tell you
52405 What hath proceeded worthy note today
52406 BRUTUS I will do so But look you Cassius
52407 The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow
52408 And all the rest look like a chidden train
52409 Calpurnia's cheek is pale and Cicero
52410 Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
52411 As we have seen him in the Capitol
52412 Being cross'd in conference by some senators
52413 CASSIUS Casca will tell us what the matter is
52414 CAESAR Antonio
52415 ANTONY Caesar
52416 CAESAR Let me have men about me that are fat
52417 Sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
52418 Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
52419 He thinks too much such men are dangerous
52420 ANTONY Fear him not Caesar he's not dangerous
52421 He is a noble Roman and well given
52422 CAESAR Would he were fatter But I fear him not
52423 Yet if my name were liable to fear
52424 I do not know the man I should avoid
52425 So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
52426 He is a great observer and he looks
52427 Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays
52428 As thou dost Antony he hears no music
52429 Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
52430 As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
52431 That could be moved to smile at anything
52432 Such men as he be never at heart's ease
52433 Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
52434 And therefore are they very dangerous
52435 I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
52436 Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
52437 Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
52438 And tell me truly what thou think'st of him
52439 Sennet Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca
52440 CASCA You pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with me
52441 BRUTUS Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today
52442 That Caesar looks so sad
52443 CASCA Why you were with him were you not
52444 BRUTUS I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
52445 CASCA Why there was a crown offered him and being offered him
52446 he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
52447 people fell ashouting
52448 BRUTUS What was the second noise for
52449 CASCA Why for that too
52450 CASSIUS They shouted thrice What was the last cry for
52451 CASCA Why for that too
52452 BRUTUS Was the crown offered him thrice
52453 CASCA Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler
52454 than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
52455 shouted
52456 CASSIUS Who offered him the crown
52457 CASCA Why Antony
52458 BRUTUS Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
52459 CASCA I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it It was
52460 mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a
52461 crown yet 'twas not a crown neither 'twas one of these
52462 coronets and as I told you he put it by once But for all
52463 that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered
52464 it to him again then he put it by again But to my thinking he
52465 was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered it
52466 the third time he put it the third time by and still as he
52467 refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands
52468 and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
52469 stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had
52470 almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it And
52471 for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips
52472 and receiving the bad air
52473 CASSIUS But soft I pray you what did Caesars wound
52474 CASCA He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
52475 speechless
52476 BRUTUS 'Tis very like He hath the falling sickness
52477 CASSIUS No Caesar hath it not but you and I
52478 And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
52479 CASCA I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell
52480 down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
52481 according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do
52482 the players in the theatre I am no true man
52483 BRUTUS What said he when he came unto himself
52484 CASCA Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
52485 herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet
52486 and offered them his throat to cut An had been a man of any
52487 occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I
52488 might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he came
52489 to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss
52490 he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or
52491 four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and forgave
52492 him with all their hearts But there's no heed to be taken of
52493 them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done
52494 no less
52495 BRUTUS And after that he came thus sad away
52496 CASCA Ay
52497 CASSIUS Did Cicero say anything
52498 CASCA Ay he spoke Greek
52499 CASSIUS To what effect
52500 CASCA Nay an I tell you that I'll ne'er look you i the face
52501 again but those that understood him smiled at one another and
52502 shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I
52503 could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling
52504 scarfs off Caesar's images are put to silence Fare you well
52505 There was more foolery yet if could remember it
52506 CASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight Casca
52507 CASCA No I am promised forth
52508 CASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow
52509 CASCA Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth
52510 the eating
52511 CASSIUS Good I will expect you
52512 CASCA Do so farewell both Exit
52513 BRUTUS What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
52514 He was quick mettle when he went to school
52515 CASSIUS So is he now in execution
52516 Of any bold or noble enterprise
52517 However he puts on this tardy form
52518 This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
52519 Which gives men stomach to digest his words
52520 With better appetite
52521 BRUTUS And so it is For this time I will leave you
52522 Tomorrow if you please to speak with me
52523 I will come home to you or if you will
52524 Come home to me and I will wait for you
52525 CASSIUS I will do so Till then think of the world
52526 Exit Brutus
52527 Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
52528 Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
52529 From that it is disposed therefore it is meet
52530 That noble minds keep ever with their likes
52531 For who so firm that cannot be seduced
52532 Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
52533 If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
52534 He should not humor me I will this night
52535 In several hands in at his windows throw
52536 As if they came from several citizens
52537 Writings all tending to the great opinion
52538 That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
52539 Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
52540 And after this let Caesar seat him sure
52541 For we will shake him or worse days endure Exit
52542 SCENE III
52543 A street Thunder and lightning
52544 Enter from opposite sides Casca with his sword drawn and Cicero
52545 CICERO Good even Casca Brought you Caesar home
52546 Why are you breathless and why stare you so
52547 CASCA Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
52548 Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
52549 I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
52550 Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
52551 The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
52552 To be exalted with the threatening clouds
52553 But never till tonight never till now
52554 Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
52555 Either there is a civil strife in heaven
52556 Or else the world too saucy with the gods
52557 Incenses them to send destruction
52558 CICERO Why saw you anything more wonderful
52559 CASCA A common slave you know him well by sight
52560 Held up his left hand which did flame and burn
52561 Like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand
52562 Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd
52563 Besides I ha not since put up my sword
52564 Against the Capitol I met a lion
52565 Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by
52566 Without annoying me And there were drawn
52567 Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
52568 Transformed with their fear who swore they saw
52569 Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
52570 And yesterday the bird of night did sit
52571 Even at noonday upon the marketplace
52572 Howling and shrieking When these prodigies
52573 Do so conjointly meet let not men say
52574 These are their reasons they are natural
52575 For I believe they are portentous things
52576 Unto the climate that they point upon
52577 CICERO Indeed it is a strangedisposed time
52578 But men may construe things after their fashion
52579 Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
52580 Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
52581 CASCA He doth for he did bid Antonio
52582 Send word to you he would be there tomorrow
52583 CICERO Good then Casca This disturbed sky
52584 Is not to walk in
52585 CASCA Farewell Cicero Exit Cicero
52586 Enter Cassius
52587 CASSIUS Who's there
52588 CASCA A Roman
52589 CASSIUS Casca by your voice
52590 CASCA Your ear is good Cassius what night is this
52591 CASSIUS A very pleasing night to honest men
52592 CASCA Who ever knew the heavens menace so
52593 CASSIUS Those that have known the earth so full of faults
52594 For my part I have walk'd about the streets
52595 Submitting me unto the perilous night
52596 And thus unbraced Casca as you see
52597 Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
52598 And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
52599 The breast of heaven I did present myself
52600 Even in the aim and very flash of it
52601 CASCA But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
52602 It is the part of men to fear and tremble
52603 When the most mighty gods by tokens send
52604 Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
52605 CASSIUS You are dull Casca and those sparks of life
52606 That should be in a Roman you do want
52607 Or else you use not You look pale and gaze
52608 And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
52609 To see the strange impatience of the heavens
52610 But if you would consider the true cause
52611 Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
52612 Why birds and beasts from quality and kind
52613 Why old men fools and children calculate
52614 Why all these things change from their ordinance
52615 Their natures and preformed faculties
52616 To monstrous quality why you shall find
52617 That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
52618 To make them instruments of fear and warning
52619 Unto some monstrous state
52620 Now could I Casca name to thee a man
52621 Most like this dreadful night
52622 That thunders lightens opens graves and roars
52623 As doth the lion in the Capitol
52624 A man no mightier than thyself or me
52625 In personal action yet prodigious grown
52626 And fearful as these strange eruptions are
52627 CASCA 'Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius
52628 CASSIUS Let it be who it is for Romans now
52629 Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
52630 But woe the while Our fathers minds are dead
52631 And we are govern'd with our mothers spirits
52632 Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
52633 CASCA Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
52634 Mean to establish Caesar as a king
52635 And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
52636 In every place save here in Italy
52637 CASSIUS I know where I will wear this dagger then
52638 Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
52639 Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
52640 Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
52641 Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
52642 Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
52643 Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
52644 But life being weary of these worldly bars
52645 Never lacks power to dismiss itself
52646 If I know this know all the world besides
52647 That part of tyranny that I do bear
52648 I can shake off at pleasure Thunder still
52649 CASCA So can I
52650 So every bondman in his own hand bears
52651 The power to cancel his captivity
52652 CASSIUS And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
52653 Poor man I know he would not be a wolf
52654 But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
52655 He were no lion were not Romans hinds
52656 Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
52657 Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome
52658 What rubbish and what offal when it serves
52659 For the base matter to illuminate
52660 So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
52661 Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
52662 Before a willing bondman then I know
52663 My answer must be made But I am arm'd
52664 And dangers are to me indifferent
52665 CASCA You speak to Casca and to such a man
52666 That is no fleering telltale Hold my hand
52667 Be factious for redress of all these griefs
52668 And I will set this foot of mine as far
52669 As who goes farthest
52670 CASSIUS There's a bargain made
52671 Now know you Casca I have moved already
52672 Some certain of the noblestminded Romans
52673 To undergo with me an enterprise
52674 Of honorabledangerous consequence
52675 And I do know by this they stay for me
52676 In Pompey's Porch For now this fearful night
52677 There is no stir or walking in the streets
52678 And the complexion of the element
52679 In favor's like the work we have in hand
52680 Most bloody fiery and most terrible
52681 Enter Cinna
52682 CASCA Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
52683 CASSIUS 'Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait
52684 He is a friend Cinna where haste you so
52685 CINNA To find out you Who's that Metellus Cimber
52686 CASSIUS No it is Casca one incorporate
52687 To our attempts Am I not stay'd for Cinna
52688 CINNA I am glad on't What a fearful night is this
52689 There's two or three of us have seen strange sights
52690 CASSIUS Am I not stay'd for Tell me
52691 CINNA Yes you are
52692 O Cassius if you could
52693 But win the noble Brutus to our party
52694 CASSIUS Be you content Good Cinna take this paper
52695 And look you lay it in the praetor's chair
52696 Where Brutus may but find it and throw this
52697 In at his window set this up with wax
52698 Upon old Brutus statue All this done
52699 Repair to Pompey's Porch where you shall find us
52700 Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
52701 CINNA All but Metellus Cimber and he's gone
52702 To seek you at your house Well I will hie
52703 And so bestow these papers as you bade me
52704 CASSIUS That done repair to Pompey's Theatre
52705 Exit Cinna
52706 Come Casca you and I will yet ere day
52707 See Brutus at his house Three parts of him
52708 Is ours already and the man entire
52709 Upon the next encounter yields him ours
52710 CASCA O he sits high in all the people's hearts
52711 And that which would appear offense in us
52712 His countenance like richest alchemy
52713 Will change to virtue and to worthiness
52714 CASSIUS Him and his worth and our great need of him
52715 You have right well conceited Let us go
52716 For it is after midnight and ere day
52717 We will awake him and be sure of him Exeunt

52726 ACT II SCENE I
52727 Enter Brutus in his orchard
52728 BRUTUS What Lucius ho
52729 I cannot by the progress of the stars
52730 Give guess how near to day Lucius I say
52731 I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
52732 When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius
52733 Enter Lucius
52734 LUCIUS Call'd you my lord
52735 BRUTUS Get me a taper in my study Lucius
52736 When it is lighted come and call me here
52737 LUCIUS I will my lord Exit
52738 BRUTUS It must be by his death and for my part
52739 I know no personal cause to spurn at him
52740 But for the general He would be crown'd
52741 How that might change his nature there's the question
52742 It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
52743 And that craves wary walking Crown him that
52744 And then I grant we put a sting in him
52745 That at his will he may do danger with
52746 The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
52747 Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar
52748 I have not known when his affections sway'd
52749 More than his reason But 'tis a common proof
52750 That lowliness is young ambition's ladder
52751 Whereto the climberupward turns his face
52752 But when he once attains the upmost round
52753 He then unto the ladder turns his back
52754 Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
52755 By which he did ascend So Caesar may
52756 Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
52757 Will bear no color for the thing he is
52758 Fashion it thus that what he is augmented
52759 Would run to these and these extremities
52760 And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
52761 Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous
52762 And kill him in the shell
52763 Reenter Lucius
52764 LUCIUS The taper burneth in your closet sir
52765 Searching the window for a flint I found
52766 This paper thus seal'd up and I am sure
52767 It did not lie there when I went to bed
52768 Gives him the letter
52769 BRUTUS Get you to bed again it is not day
52770 Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March
52771 LUCIUS I know not sir
52772 BRUTUS Look in the calendar and bring me word
52773 LUCIUS I will sir Exit
52774 BRUTUS The exhalations whizzing in the air
52775 Give so much light that I may read by them
52776 Opens the letter and reads
52777 Brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
52778 Shall Rome etc Speak strike redress
52779 Brutus thou sleep'st awake
52780 Such instigations have been often dropp'd
52781 Where I have took them up
52782 Shall Rome etc Thus must I piece it out
52783 Shall Rome stand under one man's awe What Rome
52784 My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
52785 The Tarquin drive when he was call'd a king
52786 Speak strike redress Am I entreated
52787 To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
52788 If the redress will follow thou receivest
52789 Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus
52790 Reenter Lucius
52791 LUCIUS Sir March is wasted fifteen days
52792 Knocking within
52793 BRUTUS 'Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks
52794 Exit Lucius
52795 Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
52796 I have not slept
52797 Between the acting of a dreadful thing
52798 And the first motion all the interim is
52799 Like a phantasma or a hideous dream
52800 The genius and the mortal instruments
52801 Are then in council and the state of man
52802 Like to a little kingdom suffers then
52803 The nature of an insurrection
52804 Reenter Lucius
52805 LUCIUS Sir 'tis your brother Cassius at the door
52806 Who doth desire to see you
52807 BRUTUS Is he alone
52808 LUCIUS No sir there are more with him
52809 BRUTUS Do you know them
52810 LUCIUS No sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears
52811 And half their faces buried in their cloaks
52812 That by no means I may discover them
52813 By any mark of favor
52814 BRUTUS Let 'em enter Exit Lucius
52815 They are the faction O Conspiracy
52816 Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
52817 When evils are most free O then by day
52818 Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
52819 To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none Conspiracy
52820 Hide it in smiles and affability
52821 For if thou path thy native semblance on
52822 Not Erebus itself were dim enough
52823 To hide thee from prevention
52824 Enter the conspirators Cassius Casca Decius Cinna
52825 Metellus Cimber and Trebonius
52826 CASSIUS I think we are too bold upon your rest
52827 Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you
52828 BRUTUS I have been up this hour awake all night
52829 Know I these men that come along with you
52830 CASSIUS Yes every man of them and no man here
52831 But honors you and every one doth wish
52832 You had but that opinion of yourself
52833 Which every noble Roman bears of you
52834 This is Trebonius
52835 BRUTUS He is welcome hither
52836 CASSIUS This Decius Brutus
52837 BRUTUS He is welcome too
52838 CASSIUS This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
52839 BRUTUS They are all welcome
52840 What watchful cares do interpose themselves
52841 Betwixt your eyes and night
52842 CASSIUS Shall I entreat a word They whisper
52843 DECIUS Here lies the east Doth not the day break here
52844 CASCA No
52845 CINNA O pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines
52846 That fret the clouds are messengers of day
52847 CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceived
52848 Here as I point my sword the sun arises
52849 Which is a great way growing on the south
52850 Weighing the youthful season of the year
52851 Some two months hence up higher toward the north
52852 He first presents his fire and the high east
52853 Stands as the Capitol directly here
52854 BRUTUS Give me your hands all over one by one
52855 CASSIUS And let us swear our resolution
52856 BRUTUS No not an oath If not the face of men
52857 The sufferance of our souls the time's abuse
52858 If these be motives weak break off betimes
52859 And every man hence to his idle bed
52860 So let highsighted tyranny range on
52861 Till each man drop by lottery But if these
52862 As I am sure they do bear fire enough
52863 To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
52864 The melting spirits of women then countrymen
52865 What need we any spur but our own cause
52866 To prick us to redress What other bond
52867 Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
52868 And will not palter And what other oath
52869 Than honesty to honesty engaged
52870 That this shall be or we will fall for it
52871 Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
52872 Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
52873 That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
52874 Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
52875 The even virtue of our enterprise
52876 Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
52877 To think that or our cause or our performance
52878 Did need an oath when every drop of blood
52879 That every Roman bears and nobly bears
52880 Is guilty of a several bastardy
52881 If he do break the smallest particle
52882 Of any promise that hath pass'd from him
52883 CASSIUS But what of Cicero Shall we sound him
52884 I think he will stand very strong with us
52885 CASCA Let us not leave him out
52886 CINNA No by no means
52887 METELLUS O let us have him for his silver hairs
52888 Will purchase us a good opinion
52889 And buy men's voices to commend our deeds
52890 It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands
52891 Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
52892 But all be buried in his gravity
52893 BRUTUS O name him not let us not break with him
52894 For he will never follow anything
52895 That other men begin
52896 CASSIUS Then leave him out
52897 CASCA Indeed he is not fit
52898 DECIUS Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar
52899 CASSIUS Decius well urged I think it is not meet
52900 Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
52901 Should outlive Caesar We shall find of him
52902 A shrewd contriver and you know his means
52903 If he improve them may well stretch so far
52904 As to annoy us all which to prevent
52905 Let Antony and Caesar fall together
52906 BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
52907 To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
52908 Like wrath in death and envy afterwards
52909 For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
52910 Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
52911 We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
52912 And in the spirit of men there is no blood
52913 O that we then could come by Caesar's spirit
52914 And not dismember Caesar But alas
52915 Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
52916 Let's kill him boldly but not wrathfully
52917 Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
52918 Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
52919 And let our hearts as subtle masters do
52920 Stir up their servants to an act of rage
52921 And after seem to chide 'em This shall make
52922 Our purpose necessary and not envious
52923 Which so appearing to the common eyes
52924 We shall be call'd purgers not murderers
52925 And for Mark Antony think not of him
52926 For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
52927 When Caesar's head is off
52928 CASSIUS Yet I fear him
52929 For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar
52930 BRUTUS Alas good Cassius do not think of him
52931 If he love Caesar all that he can do
52932 Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
52933 And that were much he should for he is given
52934 To sports to wildness and much company
52935 TREBONIUS There is no fear in himlet him not die
52936 For he will live and laugh at this hereafter
52937 Clock strikes
52938 BRUTUS Peace count the clock
52939 CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three
52940 TREBONIUS 'Tis time to part
52941 CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet
52942 Whether Caesar will come forth today or no
52943 For he is superstitious grown of late
52944 Quite from the main opinion he held once
52945 Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
52946 It may be these apparent prodigies
52947 The unaccustom'd terror of this night
52948 And the persuasion of his augurers
52949 May hold him from the Capitol today
52950 DECIUS Never fear that If he be so resolved
52951 I can o'ersway him for he loves to hear
52952 That unicorns may be betray'd with trees
52953 And bears with glasses elephants with holes
52954 Lions with toils and men with flatterers
52955 But when I tell him he hates flatterers
52956 He says he does being then most flattered
52957 Let me work
52958 For I can give his humor the true bent
52959 And I will bring him to the Capitol
52960 CASSIUS Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
52961 BRUTUS By the eighth hour Is that the utter most
52962 CINNA Be that the uttermost and fail not then
52963 METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
52964 Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
52965 I wonder none of you have thought of him
52966 BRUTUS Now good Metellus go along by him
52967 He loves me well and I have given him reasons
52968 Send him but hither and I'll fashion him
52969 CASSIUS The morning comes upon 's We'll leave you Brutus
52970 And friends disperse yourselves but all remember
52971 What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
52972 BRUTUS Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
52973 Let not our looks put on our purposes
52974 But bear it as our Roman actors do
52975 With untired spirits and formal constancy
52976 And so good morrow to you every one
52977 Exeunt all but Brutus
52978 Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
52979 Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
52980 Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
52981 Which busy care draws in the brains of men
52982 Therefore thou sleep'st so sound
52983 Enter Portia
52984 PORTIA Brutus my lord
52985 BRUTUS Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now
52986 It is not for your health thus to commit
52987 Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
52988 PORTIA Nor for yours neither have ungently Brutus
52989 Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
52990 You suddenly arose and walk'd about
52991 Musing and sighing with your arms across
52992 And when I ask'd you what the matter was
52993 You stared upon me with ungentle looks
52994 I urged you further then you scratch'd your head
52995 And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot
52996 Yet I insisted yet you answer'd not
52997 But with an angry waiter of your hand
52998 Gave sign for me to leave you So I did
52999 Fearing to strengthen that impatience
53000 Which seem'd too much enkindled and withal
53001 Hoping it was but an effect of humor
53002 Which sometime hath his hour with every man
53003 It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
53004 And could it work so much upon your shape
53005 As it hath much prevail'd on your condition
53006 I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
53007 Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
53008 BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all
53009 PORTIA Brutus is wise and were he not in health
53010 He would embrace the means to come by it
53011 BRUTUS Why so I do Good Portia go to bed
53012 PORTIA Is Brutus sick and is it physical
53013 To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
53014 Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
53015 And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
53016 To dare the vile contagion of the night
53017 And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
53018 To add unto his sickness No my Brutus
53019 You have some sick offense within your mind
53020 Which by the right and virtue of my place
53021 I ought to know of and upon my knees
53022 I charm you by my once commended beauty
53023 By all your vows of love and that great vow
53024 Which did incorporate and make us one
53025 That you unfold to me yourself your half
53026 Why you are heavy and what men tonight
53027 Have had resort to you for here have been
53028 Some six or seven who did hide their faces
53029 Even from darkness
53030 BRUTUS Kneel not gentle Portia
53031 PORTIA I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
53032 Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
53033 Is it excepted I should know no secrets
53034 That appertain to you Am I yourself
53035 But as it were in sort or limitation
53036 To keep with you at meals comfort your bed
53037 And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
53038 Of your good pleasure If it be no more
53039 Portia is Brutus harlot not his wife
53040 BRUTUS You are my true and honorable wife
53041 As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
53042 That visit my sad heart
53043 PORTIA If this were true then should I know this secret
53044 I grant I am a woman but withal
53045 A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
53046 I grant I am a woman but withal
53047 A woman well reputed Cato's daughter
53048 Think you I am no stronger than my sex
53049 Being so father'd and so husbanded
53050 Tell me your counsels I will not disclose 'em
53051 I have made strong proof of my constancy
53052 Giving myself a voluntary wound
53053 Here in the thigh Can I bear that with patience
53054 And not my husband's secrets
53055 BRUTUS O ye gods
53056 Render me worthy of this noble wife Knocking within
53057 Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
53058 And by and by thy bosom shall partake
53059 The secrets of my heart
53060 All my engagements I will construe to thee
53061 All the charactery of my sad brows
53062 Leave me with haste [Exit Portia] Lucius who's that knocks
53063 Reenter Lucius with Ligarius
53064 LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you
53065 BRUTUS Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of
53066 Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how
53067 LIGARIUS Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
53068 BRUTUS O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
53069 To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick
53070 LIGARIUS I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
53071 Any exploit worthy the name of honor
53072 BRUTUS Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
53073 Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
53074 LIGARIUS By all the gods that Romans bow before
53075 I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
53076 Brave son derived from honorable loins
53077 Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
53078 My mortified spirit Now bid me run
53079 And I will strive with things impossible
53080 Yea get the better of them What's to do
53081 BRUTUS A piece of work that will make sick men whole
53082 LIGARIUS But are not some whole that we must make sick
53083 BRUTUS That must we also What it is my Caius
53084 I shall unfold to thee as we are going
53085 To whom it must be done
53086 LIGARIUS Set on your foot
53087 And with a heart newfired I follow you
53088 To do I know not what but it sufficeth
53089 That Brutus leads me on
53090 BRUTUS Follow me then Exeunt
53091 SCENE II
53092 Caesar's house Thunder and lightning
53093 Enter Caesar in his nightgown
53094 CAESAR Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
53095 Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
53096 Help ho They murther Caesar Who's within
53097 Enter a Servant
53098 SERVANT My lord
53099 CAESAR Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
53100 And bring me their opinions of success
53101 SERVANT I will my lord Exit
53102 Enter Calpurnia
53103 CALPURNIA What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth
53104 You shall not stir out of your house today
53105 CAESAR Caesar shall forth the things that threaten'd me
53106 Ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see
53107 The face of Caesar they are vanished
53108 CALPURNIA Caesar I I stood on ceremonies
53109 Yet now they fright me There is one within
53110 Besides the things that we have heard and seen
53111 Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
53112 A lioness hath whelped in the streets
53113 And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead
53114 Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
53115 In ranks and squadrons and right form of war
53116 Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
53117 The noise of battle hurtled in the air
53118 Horses did neigh and dying men did groan
53119 And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
53120 O Caesar These things are beyond all use
53121 And I do fear them
53122 CAESAR What can be avoided
53123 Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
53124 Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
53125 Are to the world in general as to Caesar
53126 CALPURNIA When beggars die there are no comets seen
53127 The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
53128 CAESAR Cowards die many times before their deaths
53129 The valiant never taste of death but once
53130 Of all the wonders that I yet have heard
53131 It seems to me most strange that men should fear
53132 Seeing that death a necessary end
53133 Will come when it will come
53134 Reenter Servant
53135 What say the augurers
53136 SERVANT They would not have you to stir forth today
53137 Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
53138 They could not find a heart within the beast
53139 CAESAR The gods do this in shame of cowardice
53140 Caesar should be a beast without a heart
53141 If he should stay at home today for fear
53142 No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well
53143 That Caesar is more dangerous than he
53144 We are two lions litter'd in one day
53145 And I the elder and more terrible
53146 And Caesar shall go forth
53147 CALPURNIA Alas my lord
53148 Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
53149 Do not go forth today Call it my fear
53150 That keeps you in the house and not your own
53151 We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House
53152 And he shall say you are not well today
53153 Let me upon my knee prevail in this
53154 CAESAR Mark Antony shall say I am not well
53155 And for thy humor I will stay at home
53156 Enter Decius
53157 Here's Decius Brutus he shall tell them so
53158 DECIUS Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar
53159 I come to fetch you to the Senate House
53160 CAESAR And you are come in very happy time
53161 To bear my greeting to the senators
53162 And tell them that I will not come today
53163 Cannot is false and that I dare not falser
53164 I will not come today Tell them so Decius
53165 CALPURNIA Say he is sick
53166 CAESAR Shall Caesar send a lie
53167 Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
53168 To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
53169 Decius go tell them Caesar will not come
53170 DECIUS Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause
53171 Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so
53172 CAESAR The cause is in my will I will not come
53173 That is enough to satisfy the Senate
53174 But for your private satisfaction
53175 Because I love you I will let you know
53176 Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
53177 She dreamt tonight she saw my statue
53178 Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
53179 Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
53180 Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
53181 And these does she apply for warnings and portents
53182 And evils imminent and on her knee
53183 Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today
53184 DECIUS This dream is all amiss interpreted
53185 It was a vision fair and fortunate
53186 Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
53187 In which so many smiling Romans bathed
53188 Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
53189 Reviving blood and that great men shall press
53190 For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
53191 This by Calpurnia's dream is signified
53192 CAESAR And this way have you well expounded it
53193 DECIUS I have when you have heard what I can say
53194 And know it now the Senate have concluded
53195 To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
53196 If you shall send them word you will not come
53197 Their minds may change Besides it were a mock
53198 Apt to be render'd for someone to say
53199 Break up the Senate till another time
53200 When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams
53201 If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
53202 Lo Caesar is afraid
53203 Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
53204 To your proceeding bids me tell you this
53205 And reason to my love is liable
53206 CAESAR How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
53207 I am ashamed I did yield to them
53208 Give me my robe for I will go
53209 Enter Publius Brutus Ligarius Metellus Casca
53210 Trebonius and Cinna
53211 And look where Publius is come to fetch me
53212 PUBLIUS Good morrowCaesar
53213 CAESAR Welcome Publius
53214 What Brutus are you stirr'd so early too
53215 Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius
53216 Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
53217 As that same ague which hath made you lean
53218 What is't o'clock
53219 BRUTUS Caesar 'tis strucken eight
53220 CAESAR I thank you for your pains and courtesy
53221 Enter Antony
53222 See Antony that revels long o nights
53223 Is notwithstanding up Good morrow Antony
53224 ANTONY So to most noble Caesar
53225 CAESAR Bid them prepare within
53226 I am to blame to be thus waited for
53227 Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
53228 I have an hour's talk in store for you
53229 Remember that you call on me today
53230 Be near me that I may remember you
53231 TREBONIUS Caesar I will [Aside] And so near will I be
53232 That your best friends shall wish I had been further
53233 CAESAR Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
53234 And we like friends will straightway go together
53235 BRUTUS [Aside] That every like is not the same O Caesar
53236 The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon Exeunt
53237 SCENE III
53238 A street near the Capitol
53239 Enter Artemidorus reading paper
53240 ARTEMIDORUS Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come
53241 not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark
53242 well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast
53243 wronged Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men
53244 and it is bent against Caesar If thou beest not immortal look
53245 about you Security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods
53246 defend thee
53247 Thy lover Artemidorus
53248 Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
53249 And as a suitor will I give him this
53250 My heart laments that virtue cannot live
53251 Out of the teeth of emulation
53252 If thou read this O Caesar thou mayest live
53253 If not the Fates with traitors do contrive Exit
53254 SCENE IV

53318 ACT III SCENE I
53319 Rome Before the Capitol the Senate sitting above
53320 A crowd of people among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer
53321 Flourish Enter Caesar Brutus Cassius Casca Decius Metellus
53322 Trebonius Cinna Antony Lepidus Popilius Publius and others
53323 CAESAR The ides of March are come
53324 SOOTHSAYER Ay Caesar but not gone
53325 A Hail Caesar Read this schedule
53326 DECIUS Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read
53327 At your best leisure this his humble suit
53328 ARTEMIDORUS O Caesar read mine first for mine's a suit
53329 That touches Caesar nearer Read it great Caesar
53330 CAESAR What touches us ourself shall be last served
53331 ARTEMIDORUS Delay not Caesar read it instantly
53332 CAESAR What is the fellow mad
53333 PUBLIUS Sirrah give place
53334 CASSIUS What urge you your petitions in the street
53335 Come to the Capitol
53336 Caesar goes up to the Senate House the rest follow
53337 POPILIUS I wish your enterprise today may thrive
53338 CASSIUS What enterprise Popilius
53339 POPILIUS Fare you well
53340 Advances to Caesar
53341 BRUTUS What said Popilius Lena
53342 CASSIUS He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive
53343 I fear our purpose is discovered
53344 BRUTUS Look how he makes to Caesar Mark him
53345 CASSIUS Casca
53346 Be sudden for we fear prevention
53347 Brutus what shall be done If this be known
53348 Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back
53349 For I will slay myself
53350 BRUTUS Cassius be constant
53351 Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
53352 For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change
53353 CASSIUS Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus
53354 He draws Mark Antony out of the way
53355 Exeunt Antony and Trebonius
53356 DECIUS Where is Metellus Cimber Let him
53357 And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
53358 BRUTUS He is address'd press near and second him
53359 CINNA Casca you are the first that rears your hand
53360 CAESAR Are we all ready What is now amiss
53361 That Caesar and his Senate must redress
53362 METELLUS Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar
53363 Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
53364 An humble heart Kneels
53365 CAESAR I must prevent thee Cimber
53366 These couchings and these lowly courtesies
53367 Might fire the blood of ordinary men
53368 And turn preordinance and first decree
53369 Into the law of children Be not fond
53370 To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
53371 That will be thaw'd from the true quality
53372 With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words
53373 Lowcrooked court'sies and base spanielfawning
53374 Thy brother by decree is banished
53375 If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
53376 I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
53377 Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
53378 Will he be satisfied
53379 METELLUS Is there no voice more worthy than my own
53380 To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
53381 For the repealing of my banish'd brother
53382 BRUTUS I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar
53383 Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
53384 Have an immediate freedom of repeal
53385 CAESAR What Brutus
53386 CASSIUS Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon
53387 As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
53388 To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
53389 CAESAR I could be well moved if I were as you
53390 If I could pray to move prayers would move me
53391 But I am constant as the northern star
53392 Of whose truefix'd and resting quality
53393 There is no fellow in the firmament
53394 The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks
53395 They are all fire and every one doth shine
53396 But there's but one in all doth hold his place
53397 So in the world 'tis furnish'd well with men
53398 And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
53399 Yet in the number I do know but one
53400 That unassailable holds on his rank
53401 Unshaked of motion and that I am he
53402 Let me a little show it even in this
53403 That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd
53404 And constant do remain to keep him so
53405 CINNA O Caesar
53406 CAESAR Hence Wilt thou lift up Olympus
53407 DECIUS Great Caesar
53408 CAESAR Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
53409 CASCA Speak hands for me
53410 Casca first then the other Conspirators
53411 and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar
53412 CAESAR Et tu Brute Then fall Caesar Dies
53413 CINNA Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
53414 Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
53415 CASSIUS Some to the common pulpits and cry out
53416 Liberty freedom and enfranchisement
53417 BRUTUS People and senators be not affrighted
53418 Fly not stand still ambition's debt is paid
53419 CASCA Go to the pulpit Brutus
53420 DECIUS And Cassius too
53421 BRUTUS Where's Publius
53422 CINNA Here quite confounded with this mutiny
53423 METELLUS Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar's
53424 Should chance
53425 BRUTUS Talk not of standing Publius good cheer
53426 There is no harm intended to your person
53427 Nor to no Roman else So tell them Publius
53428 CASSIUS And leave us Publius lest that the people
53429 Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
53430 BRUTUS Do so and let no man abide this deed
53431 But we the doers
53432 Reenter Trebonius
53433 CASSIUS Where is Antony
53434 TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed
53435 Men wives and children stare cry out and run
53436 As it were doomsday
53437 BRUTUS Fates we will know your pleasures
53438 That we shall die we know 'tis but the time
53439 And drawing days out that men stand upon
53440 CASSIUS Why he that cuts off twenty years of life
53441 Cuts off so many years of fearing death
53442 BRUTUS Grant that and then is death a benefit
53443 So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged
53444 His time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
53445 And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
53446 Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
53447 Then walk we forth even to the marketplace
53448 And waving our red weapons o'er our heads
53449 Let's all cry Peace freedom and liberty
53450 CASSIUS Stoop then and wash How many ages hence
53451 Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
53452 In states unborn and accents yet unknown
53453 BRUTUS How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
53454 That now on Pompey's basis lies along
53455 No worthier than the dust
53456 CASSIUS So oft as that shall be
53457 So often shall the knot of us be call'd
53458 The men that gave their country liberty
53459 DECIUS What shall we forth
53460 CASSIUS Ay every man away
53461 Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
53462 With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
53463 Enter a Servant
53464 BRUTUS Soft who comes here A friend of Antony's
53465 SERVANT Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
53466 Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
53467 And being prostrate thus he bade me say
53468 Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
53469 Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
53470 Say I love Brutus and I honor him
53471 Say I fear'd Caesar honor'd him and loved him
53472 If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
53473 May safely come to him and be resolved
53474 How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
53475 Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
53476 So well as Brutus living but will follow
53477 The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
53478 Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
53479 With all true faith So says my master Antony
53480 BRUTUS Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
53481 I never thought him worse
53482 Tell him so please him come unto this place
53483 He shall be satisfied and by my honor
53484 Depart untouch'd
53485 SERVANT I'll fetch him presently Exit
53486 BRUTUS I know that we shall have him well to friend
53487 CASSIUS I wish we may but yet have I a mind
53488 That fears him much and my misgiving still
53489 Falls shrewdly to the purpose
53490 Reenter Antony
53491 BRUTUS But here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
53492 ANTONY O mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low
53493 Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
53494 Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
53495 I know not gentlemen what you intend
53496 Who else must be let blood who else is rank
53497 If I myself there is no hour so fit
53498 As Caesar's death's hour nor no instrument
53499 Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
53500 With the most noble blood of all this world
53501 I do beseech ye if you bear me hard
53502 Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
53503 Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years
53504 I shall not find myself so apt to die
53505 No place will please me so no means of death
53506 As here by Caesar and by you cut off
53507 The choice and master spirits of this age
53508 BRUTUS O Antony beg not your death of us
53509 Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
53510 As by our hands and this our present act
53511 You see we do yet see you but our hands
53512 And this the bleeding business they have done
53513 Our hearts you see not they are pitiful
53514 And pity to the general wrong of Rome
53515 As fire drives out fire so pity pity
53516 Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part
53517 To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
53518 Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
53519 Of brothers temper do receive you in
53520 With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
53521 CASSIUS Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
53522 In the disposing of new dignities
53523 BRUTUS Only be patient till we have appeased
53524 The multitude beside themselves with fear
53525 And then we will deliver you the cause
53526 Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him
53527 Have thus proceeded
53528 ANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom
53529 Let each man render me his bloody hand
53530 First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
53531 Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
53532 Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus
53533 Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours
53534 Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
53535 Gentlemen all alas what shall I say
53536 My credit now stands on such slippery ground
53537 That one of two bad ways you must conceit me
53538 Either a coward or a flatterer
53539 That I did love thee Caesar O 'tis true
53540 If then thy spirit look upon us now
53541 Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
53542 To see thy Antony making his peace
53543 Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
53544 Most noble In the presence of thy corse
53545 Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
53546 Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
53547 It would become me better than to close
53548 In terms of friendship with thine enemies
53549 Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bay'd brave hart
53550 Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
53551 Sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy Lethe
53552 O world thou wast the forest to this hart
53553 And this indeed O world the heart of thee
53554 How like a deer strucken by many princes
53555 Dost thou here lie
53556 CASSIUS Mark Antony
53557 ANTONY Pardon me Caius Cassius
53558 The enemies of Caesar shall say this
53559 Then in a friend it is cold modesty
53560 CASSIUS I blame you not for praising Caesar so
53561 But what compact mean you to have with us
53562 Will you be prick'd in number of our friends
53563 Or shall we on and not depend on you
53564 ANTONY Therefore I took your hands but was indeed
53565 Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar
53566 Friends am I with you all and love you all
53567 Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
53568 Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
53569 BRUTUS Or else were this a savage spectacle
53570 Our reasons are so full of good regard
53571 That were you Antony the son of Caesar
53572 You should be satisfied
53573 ANTONY That's all I seek
53574 And am moreover suitor that I may
53575 Produce his body to the marketplace
53576 And in the pulpit as becomes a friend
53577 Speak in the order of his funeral
53578 BRUTUS You shall Mark Antony
53579 CASSIUS Brutus a word with you
53580 [Aside to Brutus] You know not what you do Do not consent
53581 That Antony speak in his funeral
53582 Know you how much the people may be moved
53583 By that which he will utter
53584 BRUTUS By your pardon
53585 I will myself into the pulpit first
53586 And show the reason of our Caesar's death
53587 What Antony shall speak I will protest
53588 He speaks by leave and by permission
53589 And that we are contented Caesar shall
53590 Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
53591 It shall advantage more than do us wrong
53592 CASSIUS I know not what may fall I like it not
53593 BRUTUS Mark Antony here take you Caesar's body
53594 You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
53595 But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
53596 And say you do't by our permission
53597 Else shall you not have any hand at all
53598 About his funeral And you shall speak
53599 In the same pulpit whereto I am going
53600 After my speech is ended
53601 ANTONY Be it so
53602 I do desire no more
53603 BRUTUS Prepare the body then and follow us
53604 Exeunt all but Antony
53605 ANTONY O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
53606 That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
53607 Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
53608 That ever lived in the tide of times
53609 Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
53610 Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
53611 Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
53612 To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
53613 A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
53614 Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
53615 Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
53616 Blood and destruction shall be so in use
53617 And dreadful objects so familiar
53618 That mothers shall but smile when they behold
53619 Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war
53620 All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
53621 And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge
53622 With Ate by his side come hot from hell
53623 Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
53624 Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war
53625 That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
53626 With carrion men groaning for burial
53627 Enter a Servant
53628 You serve Octavius Caesar do you not
53629 SERVANT I do Mark Antony
53630 ANTONY Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
53631 SERVANT He did receive his letters and is coming
53632 And bid me say to you by word of mouth
53633 O Caesar Sees the body
53634 ANTONY Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
53635 Passion I see is catching for mine eyes
53636 Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
53637 Began to water Is thy master coming
53638 SERVANT He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome
53639 ANTONY Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
53640 Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
53641 No Rome of safety for Octavius yet
53642 Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
53643 Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
53644 Into the marketplace There shall I try
53645 In my oration how the people take
53646 The cruel issue of these bloody men
53647 According to the which thou shalt discourse
53648 To young Octavius of the state of things
53649 Lend me your hand Exeunt with Caesar's body

53671 wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If
53672 there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar's to
53673 him I say that Brutus love to Caesar was no less than his If
53674 then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is
53675 my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome
53676 more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than
53677 that Caesar were dead to live all freemen As Caesar loved me I
53678 weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was
53679 valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I slew him There
53680 is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor
53681 and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a
53682 bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so
53683 rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I
53684 offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If
53685 any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply
53686 ALL None Brutus none
53687 BRUTUS Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar
53688 than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is

53690 worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death

53693 no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a
53694 place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I
53695 depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I

53729 ANTONY You gentle Romans
53730 ALL Peace ho Let us hear him
53731 ANTONY Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
53732 I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
53733 The evil that men do lives after them
53734 The good is oft interred with their bones
53735 So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
53736 Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
53737 If it were so it was a grievous fault
53738 And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it
53739 Here under leave of Brutus and the rest
53740 For Brutus is an honorable man
53741 So are they all all honorable men
53742 Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral
53743 He was my friend faithful and just to me
53744 But Brutus says he was ambitious
53745 And Brutus is an honorable man
53746 He hath brought many captives home to Rome
53747 Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
53748 Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
53749 When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
53750 Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
53751 Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
53752 And Brutus is an honorable man
53753 You all did see that on the Lupercal
53754 I thrice presented him a kingly crown
53755 Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition
53756 Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
53757 And sure he is an honorable man
53758 I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
53759 But here I am to speak what I do know
53760 You all did love him once not without cause
53761 What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
53762 O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts
53763 And men have lost their reason Bear with me
53764 My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
53765 And I must pause till it come back to me
53766 FIRST CITIZEN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings
53767 SECOND CITIZEN If thou consider rightly of the matter
53768 Caesar has had great wrong
53769 THIRD CITIZEN Has he masters
53770 I fear there will a worse come in his place
53771 FOURTH CITIZEN Mark'd ye his words He would not take the crown
53772 Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious
53773 FIRST CITIZEN If it be found so some will dear abide it
53774 SECOND CITIZEN Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
53775 THIRD CITIZEN There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
53776 FOURTH CITIZEN Now mark him he begins again to speak
53777 ANTONY But yesterday the word of Caesar might
53778 Have stood against the world Now lies he there
53779 And none so poor to do him reverence
53780 O masters If I were disposed to stir
53781 Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
53782 I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
53783 Who you all know are honorable men
53784 I will not do them wrong I rather choose
53785 To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
53786 Than I will wrong such honorable men
53787 But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar
53788 I found it in his closet 'tis his will
53789 Let but the commons hear this testament
53790 Which pardon me I do not mean to read
53791 And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
53792 And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
53793 Yea beg a hair of him for memory
53794 And dying mention it within their wills
53795 Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
53796 Unto their issue
53797 FOURTH CITIZEN We'll hear the will Read it Mark Antony
53798 ALL The will the will We will hear Caesar's will
53799 ANTONY Have patience gentle friends I must not read it
53800 It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
53801 You are not wood you are not stones but men
53802 And being men hearing the will of Caesar
53803 It will inflame you it will make you mad
53804 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
53805 For if you should O what would come of it
53806 FOURTH CITIZEN Read the will we'll hear it Antony
53807 You shall read us the will Caesar's will
53808 ANTONY Will you be patient Will you stay awhile
53809 I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
53810 I fear I wrong the honorable men
53811 Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar I do fear it
53812 FOURTH CITIZEN They were traitors Honorable men
53813 ALL The will The testament
53814 SECOND CITIZEN They were villains murtherers The will
53815 Read the will
53816 ANTONY You will compel me then to read the will
53817 Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar
53818 And let me show you him that made the will
53819 Shall I descend And will you give me leave
53820 ALL Come down
53821 SECOND CITIZEN Descend
53822 He comes down from the pulpit
53823 THIRD CITIZEN You shall have leave
53824 FOURTH CITIZEN A ring stand round
53825 FIRST CITIZEN Stand from the hearse stand from the body
53826 SECOND CITIZEN Room for Antony most noble Antony
53827 ANTONY Nay press not so upon me stand far off
53828 ALL Stand back room bear back
53829 ANTONY If you have tears prepare to shed them now
53830 You all do know this mantle I remember
53831 The first time ever Caesar put it on
53832 'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent
53833 That day he overcame the Nervii
53834 Look in this place ran Cassius dagger through
53835 See what a rent the envious Casca made
53836 Through this the wellbeloved Brutus stabb'd
53837 And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away
53838 Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it
53839 As rushing out of doors to be resolved
53840 If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no
53841 For Brutus as you know was Caesar's angel
53842 Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
53843 This was the most unkindest cut of all
53844 For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
53845 Ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
53846 Quite vanquish'd him Then burst his mighty heart
53847 And in his mantle muffling up his face
53848 Even at the base of Pompey's statue
53849 Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
53850 O what a fall was there my countrymen
53851 Then I and you and all of us fell down
53852 Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us
53853 O now you weep and I perceive you feel
53854 The dint of pity These are gracious drops
53855 Kind souls what weep you when you but behold
53856 Our Caesar's vesture wounded Look you here
53857 Here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors

53860 THIRD CITIZEN O woeful day
53861 FOURTH CITIZEN O traitors villains
53862 FIRST CITIZEN O most bloody sight
53863 SECOND CITIZEN We will be revenged
53864 ALL Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill
53865 Slay Let not a traitor live
53866 ANTONY Stay countrymen
53867 FIRST CITIZEN Peace there Hear the noble Antony
53868 SECOND CITIZEN We'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with
53869 him
53870 ANTONY Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
53871 To such a sudden flood of mutiny
53872 They that have done this deed are honorable
53873 What private griefs they have alas I know not
53874 That made them do it They are wise and honorable
53875 And will no doubt with reasons answer you
53876 I come not friends to steal away your hearts
53877 I am no orator as Brutus is
53878 But as you know me all a plain blunt man
53879 That love my friend and that they know full well
53880 That gave me public leave to speak of him
53881 For I have neither wit nor words nor worth
53882 Action nor utterance nor the power of speech
53883 To stir men's blood I only speak right on
53884 I tell you that which you yourselves do know
53885 Show you sweet Caesar's wounds poor dumb mouths
53886 And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus
53887 And Brutus Antony there were an Antony
53888 Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
53889 In every wound of Caesar that should move
53890 The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
53891 ALL We'll mutiny
53892 FIRST CITIZEN We'll burn the house of Brutus
53893 THIRD CITIZEN Away then Come seek the conspirators
53894 ANTONY Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
53895 ALL Peace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony
53896 ANTONY Why friends you go to do you know not what
53897 Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
53898 Alas you know not I must tell you then
53899 You have forgot the will I told you of
53900 ALL Most true the will Let's stay and hear the will
53901 ANTONY Here is the will and under Caesar's seal
53902 To every Roman citizen he gives

53983 ACT IV SCENE I
53984 A house in Rome Antony Octavius and Lepidus seated at a table
53985 ANTONY These many then shall die their names are prick'd
53986 OCTAVIUS Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus
53987 LEPIDUS I do consent
53988 OCTAVIUS Prick him down Antony
53989 LEPIDUS Upon condition Publius shall not live
53990 Who is your sister's son Mark Antony
53991 ANTONY He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
53992 But Lepidus go you to Caesar's house
53993 Fetch the will hither and we shall determine
53994 How to cut off some charge in legacies
53995 LEPIDUS What shall I find you here
53996 OCTAVIUS Or here or at the Capitol Exit Lepidus
53997 ANTONY This is a slight unmeritable man
53998 Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit
53999 The threefold world divided he should stand
54000 One of the three to share it
54001 OCTAVIUS So you thought him
54002 And took his voice who should be prick'd to die
54003 In our black sentence and proscription
54004 ANTONY Octavius I have seen more days than you
54005 And though we lay these honors on this man
54006 To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
54007 He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
54008 To groan and sweat under the business
54009 Either led or driven as we point the way
54010 And having brought our treasure where we will
54011 Then take we down his load and turn him off
54012 Like to the empty ass to shake his ears
54013 And graze in commons
54014 OCTAVIUS You may do your will
54015 But he's a tried and valiant soldier
54016 ANTONY So is my horse Octavius and for that
54017 I do appoint him store of provender
54018 It is a creature that I teach to fight
54019 To wind to stop to run directly on
54020 His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit
54021 And in some taste is Lepidus but so
54022 He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth
54023 A barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
54024 On objects arts and imitations
54025 Which out of use and staled by other men
54026 Begin his fashion Do not talk of him
54027 But as a property And now Octavius
54028 Listen great things Brutus and Cassius
54029 Are levying powers we must straight make head
54030 Therefore let our alliance be combined
54031 Our best friends made our means stretch'd
54032 And let us presently go sit in council
54033 How covert matters may be best disclosed
54034 And open perils surest answered
54035 OCTAVIUS Let us do so for we are at the stake
54036 And bay'd about with many enemies
54037 And some that smile have in their hearts I fear
54038 Millions of mischiefs Exeunt
54039 SCENE II
54040 Camp near Sardis Before Brutus tent Drum
54041 Enter Brutus Lucilius Lucius and Soldiers Titinius and Pindarus meet them
54042 BRUTUS Stand ho
54043 LUCILIUS Give the word ho and stand
54044 BRUTUS What now Lucilius is Cassius near
54045 LUCILIUS He is at hand and Pindarus is come
54046 To do you salutation from his master
54047 BRUTUS He greets me well Your master Pindarus
54048 In his own change or by ill officers
54049 Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
54050 Things done undone but if he be at hand
54051 I shall be satisfied
54052 PINDARUS I do not doubt
54053 But that my noble master will appear
54054 Such as he is full of regard and honor
54055 BRUTUS He is not doubted A word Lucilius
54056 How he received you Let me be resolved
54057 LUCILIUS With courtesy and with respect enough
54058 But not with such familiar instances
54059 Nor with such free and friendly conference
54060 As he hath used of old
54061 BRUTUS Thou hast described
54062 A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius
54063 When love begins to sicken and decay
54064 It useth an enforced ceremony
54065 There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
54066 But hollow men like horses hot at hand
54067 Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
54068 But when they should endure the bloody spur
54069 They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
54070 Sink in the trial Comes his army on
54071 LUCILIUS They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd
54072 The greater part the horse in general
54073 Are come with Cassius Low march within

54081 THIRD SOLDIER Stand
54082 CASSIUS Most noble brother you have done me wrong
54083 BRUTUS Judge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies
54084 And if not so how should I wrong a brother
54085 CASSIUS Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
54086 And when you do them
54087 BRUTUS Cassius be content
54088 Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
54089 Before the eyes of both our armies here
54090 Which should perceive nothing but love from us
54091 Let us not wrangle Bid them move away
54092 Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
54093 And I will give you audience
54094 CASSIUS Pindarus
54095 Bid our commanders lead their charges off
54096 A little from this ground
54097 BRUTUS Lucilius do you the like and let no man
54098 Come to our tent till we have done our conference
54099 Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door Exeunt
54100 SCENE III
54101 Brutus tent
54102 Enter Brutus and Cassius
54103 CASSIUS That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this
54104 You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
54105 For taking bribes here of the Sardians
54106 Wherein my letters praying on his side
54107 Because I knew the man were slighted off
54108 BRUTUS You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case
54109 CASSIUS In such a time as this it is not meet
54110 That every nice offense should bear his comment
54111 BRUTUS Let me tell you Cassius you yourself
54112 Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm
54113 To sell and mart your offices for gold
54114 To undeservers
54115 CASSIUS I an itching palm
54116 You know that you are Brutus that speaks this
54117 Or by the gods this speech were else your last
54118 BRUTUS The name of Cassius honors this corruption
54119 And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
54120 CASSIUS Chastisement
54121 BRUTUS Remember March the ides of March remember
54122 Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake
54123 What villain touch'd his body that did stab
54124 And not for justice What shall one of us
54125 That struck the foremost man of all this world
54126 But for supporting robbers shall we now
54127 Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
54128 And sell the mighty space of our large honors
54129 For so much trash as may be grasped thus
54130 I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
54131 Than such a Roman
54132 CASSIUS Brutus bait not me
54133 I'll not endure it You forget yourself
54134 To hedge me in I am a soldier I
54135 Older in practice abler than yourself
54136 To make conditions
54137 BRUTUS Go to you are not Cassius
54138 CASSIUS I am
54139 BRUTUS I say you are not
54140 CASSIUS Urge me no more I shall forget myself
54141 Have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
54142 BRUTUS Away slight man
54143 CASSIUS Is't possible
54144 BRUTUS Hear me for I will speak
54145 Must I give way and room to your rash choler
54146 Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
54147 CASSIUS O gods ye gods Must I endure all this
54148 BRUTUS All this Ay more Fret till your proud heart break
54149 Go show your slaves how choleric you are
54150 And make your bondmen tremble Must I bouge
54151 Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch
54152 Under your testy humor By the gods
54153 You shall digest the venom of your spleen
54154 Though it do split you for from this day forth
54155 I'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
54156 When you are waspish
54157 CASSIUS Is it come to this
54158 BRUTUS You say you are a better soldier
54159 Let it appear so make your vaunting true
54160 And it shall please me well For mine own part
54161 I shall be glad to learn of noble men
54162 CASSIUS You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
54163 I said an elder soldier not a better
54164 Did I say better
54165 BRUTUS If you did I care not
54166 CASSIUS When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
54167 BRUTUS Peace peace You durst not so have tempted him
54168 CASSIUS I durst not
54169 BRUTUS No
54170 CASSIUS What durst not tempt him
54171 BRUTUS For your life you durst not
54172 CASSIUS Do not presume too much upon my love
54173 I may do that I shall be sorry for
54174 BRUTUS You have done that you should be sorry for
54175 There is no terror Cassius in your threats
54176 For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
54177 That they pass by me as the idle wind
54178 Which I respect not I did send to you
54179 For certain sums of gold which you denied me
54180 For I can raise no money by vile means
54181 By heaven I had rather coin my heart
54182 And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
54183 From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
54184 By any indirection I did send
54185 To you for gold to pay my legions
54186 Which you denied me Was that done like Cassius
54187 Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so
54188 When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
54189 To lock such rascal counters from his friends
54190 Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
54191 Dash him to pieces
54192 CASSIUS I denied you not
54193 BRUTUS You did
54194 CASSIUS I did not He was but a fool
54195 That brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
54196 A friend should bear his friend's infirmities
54197 But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
54198 BRUTUS I do not till you practise them on me
54199 CASSIUS You love me not
54200 BRUTUS I do not like your faults
54201 CASSIUS A friendly eye could never see such faults
54202 BRUTUS A flatterer's would not though they do appear
54203 As huge as high Olympus
54204 CASSIUS Come Antony and young Octavius come
54205 Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
54206 For Cassius is aweary of the world
54207 Hated by one he loves braved by his brother
54208 Check'd like a bondman all his faults observed
54209 Set in a notebook learn'd and conn'd by rote
54210 To cast into my teeth O I could weep
54211 My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
54212 And here my naked breast within a heart
54213 Dearer than Pluto's mine richer than gold
54214 If that thou best a Roman take it forth
54215 I that denied thee gold will give my heart
54216 Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know
54217 When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
54218 Than ever thou lovedst Cassius
54219 BRUTUS Sheathe your dagger
54220 Be angry when you will it shall have scope
54221 Do what you will dishonor shall be humor
54222 O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
54223 That carries anger as the flint bears fire
54224 Who much enforced shows a hasty spark
54225 And straight is cold again
54226 CASSIUS Hath Cassius lived
54227 To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
54228 When grief and blood illtemper'd vexeth him
54229 BRUTUS When I spoke that I was illtemper'd too

54292 BRUTUS No more I pray you
54293 Messala I have here received letters
54294 That young Octavius and Mark Antony
54295 Come down upon us with a mighty power
54296 Bending their expedition toward Philippi
54297 MESSALA Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
54298 BRUTUS With what addition
54299 MESSALA That by proscription and bills of outlawry
54300 Octavius Antony and Lepidus
54301 Have put to death an hundred senators
54302 BRUTUS There in our letters do not well agree
54303 Mine speak of seventy senators that died
54304 By their proscriptions Cicero being one
54305 CASSIUS Cicero one
54306 MESSALA Cicero is dead
54307 And by that order of proscription
54308 Had you your letters from your wife my lord
54309 BRUTUS No Messala
54310 MESSALA Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
54311 BRUTUS Nothing Messala
54312 MESSALA That methinks is strange
54313 BRUTUS Why ask you Hear you aught of her in yours
54314 MESSALA No my lord
54315 BRUTUS Now as you are a Roman tell me true
54316 MESSALA Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
54317 For certain she is dead and by strange manner
54318 BRUTUS Why farewell Portia We must die Messala
54319 With meditating that she must die once
54320 I have the patience to endure it now
54321 MESSALA Even so great men great losses should endure
54322 CASSIUS I have as much of this in art as you
54323 But yet my nature could not bear it so
54324 BRUTUS Well to our work alive What do you think
54325 Of marching to Philippi presently
54326 CASSIUS I do not think it good
54327 BRUTUS Your reason
54328 CASSIUS This it is
54329 'Tis better that the enemy seek us
54330 So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
54331 Doing himself offense whilst we lying still
54332 Are full of rest defense and nimbleness
54333 BRUTUS Good reasons must of force give place to better
54334 The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
54335 Do stand but in a forced affection
54336 For they have grudged us contribution
54337 The enemy marching along by them
54338 By them shall make a fuller number up
54339 Come on refresh'd newadded and encouraged
54340 From which advantage shall we cut him off
54341 If at Philippi we do face him there
54342 These people at our back
54343 CASSIUS Hear me good brother
54344 BRUTUS Under your pardon You must note beside
54345 That we have tried the utmost of our friends
54346 Our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
54347 The enemy increaseth every day
54348 We at the height are ready to decline
54349 There is a tide in the affairs of men
54350 Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
54351 Omitted all the voyage of their life
54352 Is bound in shallows and in miseries
54353 On such a full sea are we now afloat
54354 And we must take the current when it serves
54355 Or lose our ventures
54356 CASSIUS Then with your will go on
54357 We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi
54358 BRUTUS The deep of night is crept upon our talk
54359 And nature must obey necessity
54360 Which we will niggard with a little rest
54361 There is no more to say
54362 CASSIUS No more Good night
54363 Early tomorrow will we rise and hence
54364 BRUTUS Lucius
54365 Reenter Lucius
54366 My gown Exit Lucius
54367 Farewell good Messala
54368 Good night Titinius noble noble Cassius
54369 Good night and good repose
54370 CASSIUS O my dear brother
54371 This was an ill beginning of the night
54372 Never come such division 'tween our souls
54373 Let it not Brutus
54374 BRUTUS Everything is well
54375 CASSIUS Good night my lord

54468 ACT V SCENE I
54469 The plains of Philippi
54470 Enter Octavius Antony and their Army
54471 OCTAVIUS Now Antony our hopes are answered
54472 You said the enemy would not come down
54473 But keep the hills and upper regions
54474 It proves not so Their battles are at hand
54475 They mean to warn us at Philippi here
54476 Answering before we do demand of them
54477 ANTONY Tut I am in their bosoms and I know
54478 Wherefore they do it They could be content
54479 To visit other places and come down
54480 With fearful bravery thinking by this face
54481 To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
54482 But 'tis not so
54483 Enter a Messenger
54484 MESSENGER Prepare you generals
54485 The enemy comes on in gallant show
54486 Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
54487 And something to be done immediately
54488 ANTONY Octavius lead your battle softly on
54489 Upon the left hand of the even field
54490 OCTAVIUS Upon the right hand I keep thou the left
54491 ANTONY Why do you cross me in this exigent
54492 OCTAVIUS I do not cross you but I will do so
54493 March Drum Enter Brutus Cassius and their Army
54494 Lucilius Titinius Messala and others
54495 BRUTUS They stand and would have parley
54496 CASSIUS Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk
54497 OCTAVIUS Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
54498 ANTONY No Caesar we will answer on their charge
54499 Make forth the generals would have some words
54500 OCTAVIUS Stir not until the signal not until the signal
54501 BRUTUS Words before blows Is it so countrymen
54502 OCTAVIUS Not that we love words better as you do
54503 BRUTUS Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
54504 ANTONY In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
54505 Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart
54506 Crying Long live Hail Caesar
54507 CASSIUS Antony
54508 The posture of your blows are yet unknown
54509 But for your words they rob the Hybla bees
54510 And leave them honeyless
54511 ANTONY Not stingless too
54512 BRUTUS O yes and soundless too
54513 For you have stol'n their buzzing Antony
54514 And very wisely threat before you sting
54515 ANTONY Villains You did not so when your vile daggers
54516 Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar
54517 You show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds
54518 And bow'd like bondmen kissing Caesar's feet
54519 Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
54520 Strooke Caesar on the neck O you flatterers
54521 CASSIUS Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
54522 This tongue had not offended so today
54523 If Cassius might have ruled
54524 OCTAVIUS Come come the cause If arguing make us sweat
54525 The proof of it will turn to redder drops
54526 Look
54527 I draw a sword against conspirators
54528 When think you that the sword goes up again
54529 Never till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
54530 Be well avenged or till another Caesar
54531 Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
54532 BRUTUS Caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
54533 Unless thou bring'st them with thee
54534 OCTAVIUS So I hope
54535 I was not born to die on Brutus sword
54536 BRUTUS O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
54537 Young man thou couldst not die more honorable
54538 CASSIUS A peevish school boy worthless of such honor
54539 Join'd with a masker and a reveler
54540 ANTONY Old Cassius still
54541 OCTAVIUS Come Antony away
54542 Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
54543 If you dare fight today come to the field
54544 If not when you have stomachs
54545 Exeunt Octavius Antony and their Army
54546 CASSIUS Why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
54547 The storm is up and all is on the hazard
54548 BRUTUS Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you
54549 LUCILIUS [Stands forth] My lord
54550 Brutus and Lucilius converse apart
54551 CASSIUS Messala
54552 MESSALA [Stands forth] What says my general
54553 CASSIUS Messala
54554 This is my birthday as this very day
54555 Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
54556 Be thou my witness that against my will
54557 As Pompey was am I compell'd to set
54558 Upon one battle all our liberties
54559 You know that I held Epicurus strong
54560 And his opinion Now I change my mind
54561 And partly credit things that do presage
54562 Coming from Sardis on our former ensign
54563 Two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd
54564 Gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
54565 Who to Philippi here consorted us
54566 This morning are they fled away and gone
54567 And in their steads do ravens crows and kites
54568 Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us
54569 As we were sickly prey Their shadows seem
54570 A canopy most fatal under which
54571 Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
54572 MESSALA Believe not so
54573 CASSIUS I but believe it partly
54574 For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
54575 To meet all perils very constantly
54576 BRUTUS Even so Lucilius
54577 CASSIUS Now most noble Brutus
54578 The gods today stand friendly that we may
54579 Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
54580 But since the affairs of men rest still incertain
54581 Let's reason with the worst that may befall
54582 If we do lose this battle then is this
54583 The very last time we shall speak together
54584 What are you then determined to do
54585 BRUTUS Even by the rule of that philosophy
54586 By which I did blame Cato for the death
54587 Which he did give himself I know not how
54588 But I do find it cowardly and vile
54589 For fear of what might fall so to prevent
54590 The time of life arming myself with patience
54591 To stay the providence of some high powers
54592 That govern us below
54593 CASSIUS Then if we lose this battle
54594 You are contented to be led in triumph
54595 Thorough the streets of Rome
54596 BRUTUS No Cassius no Think not thou noble Roman
54597 That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
54598 He bears too great a mind But this same day
54599 Must end that work the ides of March begun
54600 And whether we shall meet again I know not
54601 Therefore our everlasting farewell take
54602 Forever and forever farewell Cassius
54603 If we do meet again why we shall smile
54604 If not why then this parting was well made
54605 CASSIUS Forever and forever farewell Brutus
54606 If we do meet again we'll smile indeed
54607 If not 'tis true this parting was well made
54608 BRUTUS Why then lead on O that a man might know
54609 The end of this day's business ere it come
54610 But it sufficeth that the day will end
54611 And then the end is known Come ho Away Exeunt
54612 SCENE II
54613 The field of battle
54614 Alarum Enter Brutus and Messala
54615 BRUTUS Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
54616 Unto the legions on the other side Loud alarum
54617 Let them set on at once for I perceive
54618 But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing
54619 And sudden push gives them the overthrow
54620 Ride ride Messala Let them all come down Exeunt
54621 SCENE III
54622 Another part of the field
54623 Alarums Enter Cassius and Titinius
54624 CASSIUS O look Titinius look the villains fly
54625 Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy
54626 This ensign here of mine was turning back
54627 I slew the coward and did take it from him
54628 TITINIUS O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
54629 Who having some advantage on Octavius
54630 Took it too eagerly His soldiers fell to spoil
54631 Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed
54632 Enter Pindarus
54633 PINDARUS Fly further off my lord fly further off
54634 Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
54635 Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
54636 CASSIUS This hill is far enough Look look Titinius
54637 Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
54638 TITINIUS They are my lord
54639 CASSIUS Titinius if thou lovest me
54640 Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
54641 Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
54642 And here again that I may rest assured
54643 Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
54644 TITINIUS I will be here again even with a thought Exit
54645 CASSIUS Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
54646 My sight was ever thick regard Titinius
54647 And tell me what thou notest about the field
54648 Pindarus ascends the hill
54649 This day I breathed first time is come round
54650 And where I did begin there shall I end
54651 My life is run his compass Sirrah what news
54652 PINDARUS [Above] O my lord
54653 CASSIUS What news
54654 PINDARUS [Above] Titinius is enclosed round about
54655 With horsemen that make to him on the spur
54656 Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him
54657 Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too
54658 He's ta'en [Shout] And hark They shout for joy
54659 CASSIUS Come down behold no more
54660 O coward that I am to live so long
54661 To see my best friend ta'en before my face
54662 Pindarus descends
54663 Come hither sirrah
54664 In Parthia did I take thee prisoner
54665 And then I swore thee saving of thy life
54666 That whatsoever I did bid thee do
54667 Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
54668 Now be a freeman and with this good sword
54669 That ran through Caesar's bowels search this bosom
54670 Stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
54671 And when my face is cover'd as 'tis now
54672 Guide thou the sword [Pindarus stabs him] Caesar thou art
54673 revenged
54674 Even with the sword that kill'd thee Dies
54675 PINDARUS So I am free yet would not so have been
54676 Durst I have done my will O Cassius
54677 Far from this country Pindarus shall run
54678 Where never Roman shall take note of him Exit
54679 Reenter Titinius with Messala
54680 MESSALA It is but change Titinius for Octavius
54681 Is overthrown by noble Brutus power
54682 As Cassius legions are by Antony
54683 TITINIUS These tidings would well comfort Cassius
54684 MESSALA Where did you leave him
54685 TITINIUS All disconsolate
54686 With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
54687 MESSALA Is not that he that lies upon the ground
54688 TITINIUS He lies not like the living O my heart
54689 MESSALA Is not that he
54690 TITINIUS No this was he Messala
54691 But Cassius is no more O setting sun
54692 As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
54693 So in his red blood Cassius day is set
54694 The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
54695 Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
54696 Mistrust of my success hath done this deed
54697 MESSALA Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
54698 O hateful error melancholy's child
54699 Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
54700 The things that are not O error soon conceived
54701 Thou never comest unto a happy birth
54702 But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee
54703 TITINIUS What Pindarus Where art thou Pindarus
54704 MESSALA Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
54705 The noble Brutus thrusting this report
54706 Into his ears I may say thrusting it
54707 For piercing steel and darts envenomed
54708 Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
54709 As tidings of this sight
54710 TITINIUS Hie you Messala
54711 And I will seek for Pindarus the while Exit Messala
54712 Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
54713 Did I not meet thy friends And did not they
54714 Put on my brows this wreath of victory
54715 And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts
54716 Alas thou hast misconstrued everything
54717 But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
54718 Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
54719 Will do his bidding Brutus come apace
54720 And see how I regarded Caius Cassius
54721 By your leave gods this is a Roman's part

54868 All the conspirators save only he
54869 Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
54870 He only in a general honest thought
54871 And common good to all made one of them
54872 His life was gentle and the elements
54873 So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
54874 And say to all the world This was a man
54875 OCTAVIUS According to his virtue let us use him
54876 With all respect and rites of burial
54877 Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
54878 Most like a soldier ordered honorably
54879 So call the field to rest and let's away

54929 Edmund stands back]
54930 Kent I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
54931 Cornwall
54932 Glou It did always seem so to us but now in the division of the
54933 kingdom it appears not which of the Dukes he values most for
54934 equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make
54935 choice of either's moiety
54936 Kent Is not this your son my lord
54937 Glou His breeding sir hath been at my charge I have so often
54938 blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't
54939 Kent I cannot conceive you
54940 Glou Sir this young fellow's mother could whereupon she grew
54941 roundwomb'd and had indeed sir a son for her cradle ere she
54942 had a husband for her bed Do you smell a fault
54943 Kent I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so
54944 proper
54945 Glou But I have sir a son by order of law some year elder than
54946 this who yet is no dearer in my account Though this knave came
54947 something saucily into the world before he was sent for yet was
54948 his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the
54949 whoreson must be acknowledged Do you know this noble gentleman
54950 Edmund

54966 Lear Meantime we shall express our darker purpose
54967 Give me the map there Know we have divided
54968 In three our kingdom and 'tis our fast intent
54969 To shake all cares and business from our age
54970 Conferring them on younger strengths while we
54971 Unburthen'd crawl toward death Our son of Cornwall
54972 And you our no less loving son of Albany
54973 We have this hour a constant will to publish
54974 Our daughters several dowers that future strife
54975 May be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy
54976 Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love
54977 Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
54978 And here are to be answer'd Tell me my daughters
54979 Since now we will divest us both of rule
54980 Interest of territory cares of state
54981 Which of you shall we say doth love us most
54982 That we our largest bounty may extend
54983 Where nature doth with merit challenge Goneril
54984 Our eldestborn speak first
54985 Gon Sir I love you more than words can wield the matter
54986 Dearer than eyesight space and liberty
54987 Beyond what can be valued rich or rare
54988 No less than life with grace health beauty honour
54989 As much as child e'er lov'd or father found
54990 A love that makes breath poor and speech unable
54991 Beyond all manner of so much I love you
54992 Cor [aside] What shall Cordelia speak Love and be silent
54993 Lear Of all these bounds even from this line to this

54998 Our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall Speak
54999 Reg Sir I am made
55000 Of the selfsame metal that my sister is
55001 And prize me at her worth In my true heart
55002 I find she names my very deed of love
55003 Only she comes too short that I profess
55004 Myself an enemy to all other joys
55005 Which the most precious square of sense possesses
55006 And find I am alone felicitate
55007 In your dear Highness love
55008 Cor [aside] Then poor Cordelia
55009 And yet not so since I am sure my love's
55010 More richer than my tongue
55011 Lear To thee and thine hereditary ever
55012 Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
55013 No less in space validity and pleasure
55014 Than that conferr'd on Goneril Now our joy
55015 Although the last not least to whose young love
55016 The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
55017 Strive to be interest what can you say to draw

55020 Lear Nothing
55021 Cor Nothing
55022 Lear Nothing can come of nothing Speak again
55023 Cor Unhappy that I am I cannot heave

55029 You have begot me bred me lov'd me I
55030 Return those duties back as are right fit
55031 Obey you love you and most honour you
55032 Why have my sisters husbands if they say
55033 They love you all Haply when I shall wed
55034 That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
55035 Half my love with him half my care and duty
55036 Sure I shall never marry like my sisters
55037 To love my father all
55038 Lear But goes thy heart with this
55039 Cor Ay good my lord
55040 Lear So young and so untender
55041 Cor So young my lord and true
55042 Lear Let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
55043 For by the sacred radiance of the sun
55044 The mysteries of Hecate and the night
55045 By all the operation of the orbs
55046 From whom we do exist and cease to be
55047 Here I disclaim all my paternal care
55048 Propinquity and property of blood
55049 And as a stranger to my heart and me
55050 Hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian
55051 Or he that makes his generation messes
55052 To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
55053 Be as well neighbour'd pitied and reliev'd
55054 As thou my sometime daughter
55055 Kent Good my liege
55056 Lear Peace Kent
55057 Come not between the dragon and his wrath
55058 I lov'd her most and thought to set my rest
55059 On her kind nursery Hence and avoid my sight
55060 So be my grave my peace as here I give
55061 Her father's heart from her Call France Who stirs
55062 Call Burgundy Cornwall and Albany
55063 With my two daughters dowers digest this third
55064 Let pride which she calls plainness marry her

55067 That troop with majesty Ourself by monthly course
55068 With reservation of an hundred knights

55079 Lear The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft
55080 Kent Let it fall rather though the fork invade
55081 The region of my heart Be Kent unmannerly
55082 When Lear is mad What wouldst thou do old man
55083 Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
55084 When power to flattery bows To plainness honour's bound
55085 When majesty falls to folly Reverse thy doom
55086 And in thy best consideration check
55087 This hideous rashness Answer my life my judgment
55088 Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
55089 Nor are those emptyhearted whose low sound
55090 Reverbs no hollowness
55091 Lear Kent on thy life no more
55092 Kent My life I never held but as a pawn
55093 To wage against thine enemies nor fear to lose it
55094 Thy safety being the motive
55095 Lear Out of my sight
55096 Kent See better Lear and let me still remain

55101 Lear O vassal miscreant
55102 [Lays his hand on his sword]
55103 Alb Corn Dear sir forbear
55104 Kent Do
55105 Kill thy physician and the fee bestow
55106 Upon the foul disease Revoke thy gift
55107 Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat
55108 I'll tell thee thou dost evil
55109 Lear Hear me recreant
55110 On thine allegiance hear me
55111 Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
55112 Which we durst never yet and with strain'd pride
55113 To come between our sentence and our power
55114 Which nor our nature nor our place can bear
55115 Our potency made good take thy reward
55116 Five days we do allot thee for provision
55117 To shield thee from diseases of the world
55118 And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
55119 Upon our kingdom If on the tenth day following
55120 Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions
55121 The moment is thy death Away By Jupiter
55122 This shall not be revok'd
55123 Kent Fare thee well King Since thus thou wilt appear
55124 Freedom lives hence and banishment is here
55125 [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee maid
55126 That justly think'st and hast most rightly said
55127 [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your deeds
55128 approve
55129 That good effects may spring from words of love
55130 Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu
55131 He'll shape his old course in a country new
55132 Exit
55133 Flourish Enter Gloucester with France and Burgundy Attendants
55134 Glou Here's France and Burgundy my noble lord
55135 Lear My Lord of Burgundy
55136 We first address toward you who with this king
55137 Hath rivall'd for our daughter What in the least
55138 Will you require in present dower with her
55139 Or cease your quest of love
55140 Bur Most royal Majesty
55141 I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd
55142 Nor will you tender less
55143 Lear Right noble Burgundy
55144 When she was dear to us we did hold her so
55145 But now her price is fall'n Sir there she stands
55146 If aught within that little seeming substance
55147 Or all of it with our displeasure piec'd
55148 And nothing more may fitly like your Grace
55149 She's there and she is yours
55150 Bur I know no answer
55151 Lear Will you with those infirmities she owes
55152 Unfriended new adopted to our hate
55153 Dow'r'd with our curse and stranger'd with our oath
55154 Take her or leave her
55155 Bur Pardon me royal sir
55156 Election makes not up on such conditions
55157 Lear Then leave her sir for by the pow'r that made me
55158 I tell you all her wealth [To France] For you great King
55159 I would not from your love make such a stray
55160 To match you where I hate therefore beseech you
55161 T avert your liking a more worthier way
55162 Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
55163 Almost t acknowledge hers
55164 France This is most strange
55165 That she that even but now was your best object
55166 The argument of your praise balm of your age
55167 Most best most dearest should in this trice of time
55168 Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
55169 So many folds of favour Sure her offence
55170 Must be of such unnatural degree
55171 That monsters it or your forevouch'd affection
55172 Fall'n into taint which to believe of her
55173 Must be a faith that reason without miracle
55174 Should never plant in me
55175 Cor I yet beseech your Majesty
55176 If for I want that glib and oily art
55177 To speak and purpose not since what I well intend
55178 I'll do't before I speak that you make known
55179 It is no vicious blot murther or foulness
55180 No unchaste action or dishonoured step
55181 That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour
55182 But even for want of that for which I am richer
55183 A stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue
55184 As I am glad I have not though not to have it
55185 Hath lost me in your liking
55186 Lear Better thou
55187 Hadst not been born than not t have pleas'd me better
55188 France Is it but this a tardiness in nature
55189 Which often leaves the history unspoke
55190 That it intends to do My Lord of Burgundy
55191 What say you to the lady Love's not love
55192 When it is mingled with regards that stands
55193 Aloof from th entire point Will you have her
55194 She is herself a dowry
55195 Bur Royal Lear
55196 Give but that portion which yourself propos'd
55197 And here I take Cordelia by the hand
55198 Duchess of Burgundy
55199 Lear Nothing I have sworn I am firm
55200 Bur I am sorry then you have so lost a father
55201 That you must lose a husband
55202 Cor Peace be with Burgundy
55203 Since that respects of fortune are his love
55204 I shall not be his wife
55205 France Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor
55206 Most choice forsaken and most lov'd despis'd
55207 Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
55208 Be it lawful I take up what's cast away
55209 Gods gods 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
55210 My love should kindle to inflam'd respect
55211 Thy dow'rless daughter King thrown to my chance
55212 Is queen of us of ours and our fair France

55251 known himself
55252 Gon The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then
55253 must we look to receive from his age not alone the

55299 Edm I know no news my lord
55300 Glou What paper were you reading
55301 Edm Nothing my lord
55302 Glou No What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your
55303 pocket The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide
55304 itself Let's see Come if it be nothing I shall not need
55305 spectacles
55306 Edm I beseech you sir pardon me It is a letter from my brother
55307 that I have not all o'erread and for so much as I have
55308 perus'd I find it not fit for your o'erlooking
55309 Glou Give me the letter sir

55311 in part I understand them are to blame
55312 Glou Let's see let's see
55313 Edm I hope for my brother's justification he wrote this but as
55314 an essay or taste of my virtue
55315 Glou reads 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world
55316 bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us
55317 till our oldness cannot relish them I begin to find an idle
55318 and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways
55319 not as it hath power but as it is suffer'd Come to me that
55320 of this I may speak more If our father would sleep till I

55328 found it thrown in at the casement of my closet
55329 Glou You know the character to be your brother's
55330 Edm If the matter were good my lord I durst swear it were his
55331 but in respect of that I would fain think it were not

55333 Edm It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is not in the
55334 contents
55335 Glou Hath he never before sounded you in this business
55336 Edm Never my lord But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
55337 that sons at perfect age and fathers declining the father
55338 should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
55339 Glou O villain villain His very opinion in the letter Abhorred
55340 villain Unnatural detested brutish villain worse than
55341 brutish Go sirrah seek him I'll apprehend him Abominable
55342 villain Where is he
55343 Edm I do not well know my lord If it shall please you to suspend
55344 your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
55345 better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course
55346 where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his
55347 purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
55348 in pieces the heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life
55349 for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
55350 honour and to no other pretence of danger
55351 Glou Think you so
55352 Edm If your honour judge it meet I will place you where you shall
55353 hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your
55354 satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very
55355 evening

55359 Heaven and earth Edmund seek him out wind me into him I pray
55360 you frame the business after your own wisdom I would unstate
55361 myself to be in a due resolution
55362 Edm I will seek him sir presently convey the business as I
55363 shall find means and acquaint you withal
55364 Glou These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to
55365 us Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet
55366 nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects Love cools
55367 friendship falls off brothers divide In cities mutinies in

55377 Edm This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are
55378 sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behaviour we make
55379 guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if
55380 we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion

55382 drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
55383 planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine
55384 thrusting on An admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay
55385 his goatish disposition to the charge of a star My father
55386 compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail and my
55387 nativity was under Ursa Major so that it follows I am rough and

55401 of unnaturalness between the child and the parent death
55402 dearth dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state
55403 menaces and maledictions against king and nobles needless
55404 diffidences banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts

55412 word or countenance
55413 Edg None at all
55414 Edm Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my
55415 entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
55416 qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so
55417 rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
55418 scarcely allay

55669 That you protect this course and put it on
55670 By your allowance which if you should the fault
55671 Would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep

56320 And leave thee in the storm
56321 But I will tarry the fool will stay

56595 Kent I know you Where's the King
56596 Gent Contending with the fretful elements
56597 Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
56598 Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main
56599 That things might change or cease tears his white hair
56600 Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
56601 Catch in their fury and make nothing of
56602 Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
56603 The toandfroconflicting wind and rain
56604 This night wherein the cubdrawn bear would couch
56605 The lion and the bellypinched wolf
56606 Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
56607 And bids what will take all
56608 Kent But who is with him
56609 Gent None but the fool who labours to outjest

56616 Who have as who have not that their great stars
56617 Thron'd and set high servants who seem no less
56618 Which are to France the spies and speculations
56619 Intelligent of our state What hath been seen
56620 Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes
56621 Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
56622 Against the old kind King or something deeper
56623 Whereof perchance these are but furnishings
56624 But true it is from France there comes a power
56625 Into this scattered kingdom who already
56626 Wise in our negligence have secret feet
56627 In some of our best ports and are at point
56628 To show their open banner Now to you
56629 If on my credit you dare build so far
56630 To make your speed to Dover you shall find
56631 Some that will thank you making just report
56632 Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
56633 The King hath cause to plain
56634 I am a gentleman of blood and breeding
56635 And from some knowledge and assurance offer
56636 This office to you
56637 Gent I will talk further with you

56640 Than my outwall open this purse and take
56641 What it contains If you shall see Cordelia
56642 As fear not but you shall show her this ring
56643 And she will tell you who your fellow is
56644 That yet you do not know Fie on this storm
56645 I will go seek the King
56646 Gent Give me your hand Have you no more to say
56647 Kent Few words but to effect more than all yet
56648 That when we have found the King in which your pain
56649 That way I'll this he that first lights on him
56650 Holla the other
56651 Exeunt [severally]

57385 Cannot be bordered certain in itself

57473 Kent Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
57474 grief
57475 Gent Ay sir She took them read them in my presence
57476 And now and then an ample tear trill'd down

57478 Over her passion who most rebellike
57479 Sought to be king o'er her
57480 Kent O then it mov'd her
57481 Gent Not to a rage Patience and sorrow strove
57482 Who should express her goodliest You have seen
57483 Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
57484 Were like a better way Those happy smilets
57485 That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
57486 What guests were in her eyes which parted thence
57487 As pearls from diamonds dropp'd In brief
57488 Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd
57489 If all could so become it
57490 Kent Made she no verbal question
57491 Gent Faith once or twice she heav'd the name of father
57492 Pantingly forth as if it press'd her heart
57493 Cried 'Sisters sisters Shame of ladies Sisters
57494 Kent father sisters What i th storm i th night
57495 Let pity not be believ'd There she shook
57496 The holy water from her heavenly eyes

57509 Will yield to see his daughter
57510 Gent Why good sir
57511 Kent A sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness
57512 That stripp'd her from his benediction turn'd her
57513 To foreign casualties gave her dear rights
57514 To his doghearted daughters these things sting
57515 His mind so venomously that burning shame
57516 Detains him from Cordelia

57634 The fishermen that walk upon the beach
57635 Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
57636 Diminish'd to her cock her cock a buoy
57637 Almost too small for sight The murmuring surge
57638 That on th unnumb'red idle pebble chafes
57639 Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more
57640 Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
57641 Topple down headlong
57642 Glou Set me where you stand
57643 Edg Give me your hand You are now within a foot
57644 Of th extreme verge For all beneath the moon
57645 Would I not leap upright
57646 Glou Let go my hand
57647 Here friend is another purse in it a jewel
57648 Well worth a poor man's taking Fairies and gods
57649 Prosper it with thee Go thou further off
57650 Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going
57651 Edg Now fare ye well good sir
57652 Glou With all my heart
57653 Edg [aside] Why I do trifle thus with his despair
57654 Is done to cure it
57655 Glou O you mighty gods He kneels
57656 This world I do renounce and in your sights
57657 Shake patiently my great affliction off
57658 If I could bear it longer and not fall
57659 To quarrel with your great opposeless wills
57660 My snuff and loathed part of nature should
57661 Burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him
57662 Now fellow fare thee well
57663 He falls [forward and swoons]
57664 Edg Gone sir farewell
57665 And yet I know not how conceit may rob
57666 The treasury of life when life itself
57667 Yields to the theft Had he been where he thought
57668 By this had thought been past Alive or dead
57669 Ho you sir friend Hear you sir Speak
57670 Thus might he pass indeed Yet he revives
57671 What are you sir
57672 Glou Away and let me die
57673 Edg Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
57674 So many fadom down precipitating
57675 Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg but thou dost breathe
57676 Hast heavy substance bleed'st not speak'st art sound
57677 Ten masts at each make not the altitude
57678 Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
57679 Thy life is a miracle Speak yet again
57680 Glou But have I fall'n or no
57681 Edg From the dread summit of this chalky bourn
57682 Look up aheight The shrillgorg'd lark so far
57683 Cannot be seen or heard Do but look up
57684 Glou Alack I have no eyes
57685 Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
57686 To end itself by death 'Twas yet some comfort
57687 When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
57688 And frustrate his proud will
57689 Edg Give me your arm
57690 Up so How is't Feel you your legs You stand
57691 Glou Too well too well
57692 Edg This is above all strangeness
57693 Upon the crown o th cliff what thing was that
57694 Which parted from you
57695 Glou A poor unfortunate beggar
57696 Edg As I stood here below methought his eyes
57697 Were two full moons he had a thousand noses
57698 Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea
57699 It was some fiend Therefore thou happy father
57700 Think that the clearest gods who make them honours
57701 Of men's impossibility have preserv'd thee
57702 Glou I do remember now Henceforth I'll bear
57703 Affliction till it do cry out itself
57704 'Enough enough and die That thing you speak of
57705 I took it for a man Often 'twould say
57706 'The fiend the fiend he led me to that place
57707 Edg Bear free and patient thoughts
57708 Enter Lear mad [fantastically dressed with weeds]
57709 But who comes here
57710 The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
57711 His master thus
57712 Lear No they cannot touch me for coming
57713 I am the King himself
57714 Edg O thou sidepiercing sight
57715 Lear Nature 's above art in that respect There's your press
57716 money That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper Draw me
57717 a clothier's yard Look look a mouse Peace peace this piece
57718 of toasted cheese will do't There's my gauntlet I'll prove it
57719 on a giant Bring up the brown bills O well flown bird i'
57720 th clout i th clout Hewgh Give the word
57721 Edg Sweet marjoram
57722 Lear Pass
57723 Glou I know that voice
57724 Lear Ha Goneril with a white beard They flatter'd me like a dog
57725 and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
57726 were there To say 'ay and 'no to everything I said 'Ay and
57727 'no too was no good divinity When the rain came to wet me
57728 once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would
57729 not peace at my bidding there I found 'em there I smelt 'em
57730 out Go to they are not men o their words They told me I was
57731 everything 'Tis a lie I am not agueproof
57732 Glou The trick of that voice I do well remember
57733 Is't not the King
57734 Lear Ay every inch a king
57735 When I do stare see how the subject quakes
57736 I pardon that man's life What was thy cause
57737 Adultery
57738 Thou shalt not die Die for adultery No
57739 The wren goes to't and the small gilded fly
57740 Does lecher in my sight
57741 Let copulation thrive for Gloucester's bastard son
57742 Was kinder to his father than my daughters
57743 Got 'tween the lawful sheets
57744 To't luxury pellmell for I lack soldiers
57745 Behold yond simp'ring dame
57746 Whose face between her forks presageth snow
57747 That minces virtue and does shake the head
57748 To hear of pleasure's name
57749 The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
57750 With a more riotous appetite
57751 Down from the waist they are Centaurs
57752 Though women all above
57753 But to the girdle do the gods inherit
57754 Beneath is all the fiend's
57755 There's hell there's darkness there's the sulphurous pit
57756 burning scalding stench consumption Fie fie fie pah pah
57757 Give me an ounce of civet good apothecary to sweeten my
57758 imagination There's money for thee
57759 Glou O let me kiss that hand
57760 Lear Let me wipe it first it smells of mortality
